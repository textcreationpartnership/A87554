         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Souls of men may as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be deſtroyed by poyſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as ſtarving. If Satan cannot hinder from ſome kind of taſting and receiving the grace of the Goſpel, he often perverts it poyſonfully, by making men to turn it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>laſciviouſneſſe,</hi> and even by freedome from ſin, to allow themſelves in ſinning freely. The Seducers crept into the Church in <hi>Jude</hi>'s time, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of Chriſtian Liberty, introduced un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Libertiniſm: No cheaper ſtuffe then Grace would ſerve their turns, wherewith to cloath laſciviouſneſſe; and no other Patron then the <hi>Lord Chriſt</hi> himſelfe to protect their impieties: Whether they were the Diſciples of <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> or <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> or <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> (as <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:166520:3"/>thinks) I much enquire not; ſure I am, they were of the Synagogue of Satan; he was both their Father and Maſter, whom they reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and whoſe works they did. In this Epiſtle the Apoſtle <hi>Jude,</hi> not only with Holy zeal oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them himſelf, but ſounds a Trumpet, for the rouſing up the Chriſtians, (upon whoſe Quarters theſe Seducers had fallen, to ſurpriſe their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the Doctrine of Faith,) earneſtly to contend for the preſervation of ſo precious a <hi>Depoſitum,</hi> once, and once for all delivered to their keeping. The Arguments uſed by the Apoſtle are Cogent, his Directions Prudent, and probable it is, that his Pains were in ſome degree Succeſsfull. I know no Spiritually skilfull Obſerver, but apprehends too great a Reſemblance, between the faces of thoſe, and our times. Sins in our dayes are not only committed under the enjoyment, but (in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence) by the encouragement of grace; men who now dare not ſin, are by ſome derided as ignorant of their Chriſtian liberty; and evident it is, that many live, as if being delivered <hi>from the fear of their enemies,</hi> they were delivered from the fear and ſervice of their Deliverer; and as if the <hi>Blood of the Paſſeover</hi> were not intended by
<pb facs="tcp:166520:3"/>God to be <hi>ſprinkled upon the door poſts</hi> to ſave them; but upon the threſhould of the door; for them to trample upon. Beloved friends, if God hath appointed that you ſhould reſemble theſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, to whom <hi>Jude</hi> wrote, in the danger of your times, its your duty to imbrace the directions deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to theſe Chriſtians, for your defence from thoſe dangers. A gracious heart conſiders not how bitter, but how true; not how ſmart, but how ſeaſonable any truth is. My aime in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing theſe Lectures, is to advance holineſſe, and (ſo far as I could do it, with following the mind of the Apoſtle) to oppoſe thoſe ſins, which if peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>hate</hi> not moſt, are like to <hi>hurt</hi> them moſt; and to advance thoſe duties with which, if people be not moſt in love, yet in which they are moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, and thereby moſt indangered. And now again, I beſeech you (that I may teſtifie my unfayned affection, as well by my Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle as my Book) labour to keep cloſe to God in a looſe age; ſpend not your time in complaining of the licentiouſneſſe of the times, in the mean while ſetting up a toleration in your own Hearts and Lives. That private Chriſtian, who doth not labour to oppoſe prophanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb facs="tcp:166520:4"/>with a river of tears, would never (if he could) bear it down with a ſtream of power. Lay the foundation of Mortification deep. Reſerve no luſt from the ſtroke of Jeſus Chriſt. Take heed of pleaſing your ſelves in a bare for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall profeſsion; Labour to be rooted in Chriſt: He who is but a viſible Chriſtian, may in a ſhort time ceaſe to be ſo much as viſible: He who ſpeaks of Chriſt but notionally, may in time be won to ſpeak againſt him: Love not the world. Beware of ſcandals; take them not where they are; make them not where they are not (the common ſin of our times, to black Religion, and then to fear and hate it.) Deſpiſe not the providences of God in the world; they are ſigns of Gods mind, though not of his love: Delight in the publick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and highly eſteem of faithfull Miniſters; they and Religion are commonly blaſted together. Shun Seducers; ſit down under a Miniſter, as well as under a Preacher; He who will hear everyone, may at length be brought to hear none; and he who will <hi>hear</hi> him preach who ought not, may ſoon be left to <hi>learn</hi> that which he ought not. Preſerve a tender conſcience; Every ſtep you take, fear a ſnare: Read your own hearts in
<pb facs="tcp:166520:4"/>the wickedneſſe of others. Be not ſlight in Cloſet-ſervices; and oft think of God in your ſhops, for there you think you have leaſt leaſure, but ſure you have moſt need to do ſo. Let your ſpeech be alway with grace, and a word or two of Chriſt in every company, if it may be; and yet not out of form, but feeling.</p>
            <p>Theſe Lectures here preſented might ſooner have ſeen the light, had I not lately met with ſuch hinderances (ſufficiently known) as I once expected ſhould have ſtopp'd them altogether. The main of this imployment hath lien upon me ſince that time, which, conſidering my many other Imployments (you know) hath not been long, though otherwiſe long enough to have performed this work much more exactly. I here preſent you, though not with half of the Epiſtle, yet with more then the one half of that which upon the whole I preach'd. I have not knowingly left out any paſſages delivered in the Pulpit. The other part I promiſe in the ſame Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume with this (ſo ſoon as God gives ſtrength &amp; more leiſure) if this find acceptance with the Church of God. And now (Brethren) I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are ſanctified; Reſting</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Mortification</hi> of the <hi>old</hi> man <hi>is the firſt part of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, wherby the ſtrength, power, and tyranny of ſin is weakened, and more and more aboliſh'd;</hi> like <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist, it decreaſeth;</hi> like old folks in a houſe, who are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the world, and crowded out, as it were, by the younger, the heirs: The living of the <hi>old</hi> man is onely as a clog and eye-ſore to the <hi>new.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This work of Mortification ſtands principally in theſe three <hi>acts,</hi> or degrees of acting: 1. An act of <hi>diſcerning.</hi> 2. <hi>Detesting.</hi> 3. <hi>Deſtroying</hi> ſin, the ſouls enemy. <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> cauſeth <hi>hatred;</hi> and <hi>hatred</hi> puts us upon ſeeking the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of an enemy.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. An act of <hi>diſcerning:</hi> Sin may hurt us when wee <hi>know it not;</hi> but we not <hi>hate</hi> it unleſſe we <hi>know</hi> it: Sin had <hi>deformity</hi> always, but we had not always <hi>eys</hi> to ſee it. It was <hi>Leah</hi> that lay by <hi>Jacob all night,</hi> but he diſcern'd her not till the <hi>morning.</hi> Sin is now diſcovered as it <hi>is,</hi> not as it is <hi>coloured</hi> over by Satan. Sin is uncomly onely to a <hi>renewed underſtanding:</hi> Nature never ſets up a light to diſcover its <hi>own</hi> deformities. Of <hi>others</hi> its often ſaid, <hi>They know not what they do: In underſtanding they are children,</hi> nay, <hi>brutes;</hi> they ſee with <hi>Satans</hi> ſpectacles: But a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed minde diſcerns between things that differ,</hi> looks upon the old boſom-<hi>favourite</hi> as a <hi>traytor:</hi> there are <hi>new</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of the <hi>old man.</hi> The Apoſtle not without an <hi>emphaſis</hi> ſpeaks of thoſe things wherof we are <hi>now</hi> aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; <hi>now,</hi> not formerly: nay, <hi>heretofore</hi> ſin was gloryed in: but now the ſoul ſees its not onely unſafe, and its <hi>own</hi> death, but <hi>unſutable,</hi> and the death of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> It was ſtriking at <hi>me</hi> (ſaith a gracious heart,) but <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſtep'd
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:166520:20"/>between me and the blow: Herein ſtanding ſins great <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,</hi> as that of <hi>drunkenneſſe in a mans wounds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Deteſtation: The eye increaſeth loathing.</hi> It cannot meet this ugly gueſt in any corner of the houſe, but the heart riſeth againſt it; <hi>this hatred of evill</hi> (Pſal. 97.10.) is more then of <hi>hell:</hi> its a <hi>killing look</hi> that the ſoul doth caſt upon every <hi>corruption. He that hateth his brother is a man-ſlayer;</hi> he that hateth his <hi>luſt</hi> is a <hi>ſin-ſlayer:</hi> not he that hateth the <hi>ſins</hi> or <hi>practices</hi> of his brother, but the <hi>perſon</hi> of his brother; ſo, not he that hateth the <hi>effects</hi> and <hi>fruits</hi> of ſin, but the <hi>nature</hi> of ſin; not he that hateth ſin <hi>for</hi> hell, but <hi>as</hi> hell. Every evill, by how much the <hi>nearer</hi> 'tis, by ſo much the more its <hi>hated:</hi> An evill, as it is ſo to our eſtate, names, children, wife, life, ſoul, as impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, adjacent, incumbent, inherent, admits of ſeverall degrees of hatred: Sin is an inward, a <hi>ſoul-foe. Love</hi> tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into <hi>hatred</hi> becoms <hi>most bitter; brethrens</hi> diviſions are hardeſt to <hi>reconcile;</hi> the ſouls <hi>old</hi> love is turned into <hi>new</hi> hatred; the very <hi>ground</hi> ſin treads upon is hated: There's a kinde of hatred of ones <hi>ſelf</hi> for ſin; every act that ſin hath a hand in is hated, our very <hi>duties</hi> for ſins intermixing with them; and we are angry with <hi>our ſelves</hi> that we can hate it <hi>no more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. This hatred puts forth it ſelf in labouring the <hi>destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of ſin. <hi>Love</hi> cannot be hid, neither can this <hi>hatred:</hi> The ſoul ſeeks the death of ſin by theſe ways and helps.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By <hi>lamentation to the Lord,</hi> when going to him for ſtrength with the Apoſtle, <hi>Oh wretched man that I am!</hi> was there ever a ſoul ſo <hi>ſin-pestred!</hi> Ah, woe is me, Lord, that I am compell'd to be chain'd to this block! Never did a ſlave in <hi>Egypt</hi> or <hi>Turkey</hi> ſo ſigh under bondage, as a <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying</hi> ſoul doth under <hi>corruption.</hi> The ſorrows of others are <hi>outward, ſhallow,</hi> in the <hi>eye,</hi> the <hi>look;</hi> but theſe are in the <hi>bottom</hi> of the ſoul, <hi>deep ſorrows.</hi> Its true, a man may give a louder cry at the <hi>drawing of a tooth,</hi> then ever he did <hi>pining</hi> under the deepeſt <hi>conſumption;</hi> but yet the <hi>conſumption,</hi> that is the <hi>harbinger of death,</hi> doth afflict
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:166520:21"/>him much more: and, though outward worldly grief, as for the death of a child, &amp;c. may be more intenſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive; yet <hi>grief for ſin</hi> is more deep, cloſe, ſticking, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive to the ſoul then all other ſorrows: the <hi>ſoul</hi> of a ſaint, like a ſword, may be melted, when the <hi>outward man,</hi> the ſcabbard, is whole.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſoul of a ſin-ſubduer fights againſt ſin with the <hi>Croſſe of Christ,</hi> and makes the <hi>death of Christ</hi> the <hi>death of ſin;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.25.</note> 1. By depending on his death as the <hi>meritorious cauſe</hi> of ſins ſubduing, of <hi>ſanctification</hi> and cleanſing. Chriſts <hi>purifying</hi> us being upon the <hi>condition</hi> of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.20.</note> and ſo it urgeth God thus, Lord, hath not <hi>Chriſt</hi> laid down the price of the purchaſe? why then is <hi>Satan</hi> in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? Is <hi>Satan bought</hi> out? Lord, let him be <hi>caſt</hi> out. 2. By taking a <hi>pattern</hi> from the <hi>death of Chriſt</hi> for the killing of ſin, we <hi>being planted into the ſimilitude of his death,</hi> Rom. 8.5. ſin it ſelf hanging upon the croſſe (as it were) when Chriſt died. Oh, (ſaith a gracious heart) that my corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may <hi>drink Vinegar,</hi> that they may be <hi>pierced,</hi> and <hi>naild,</hi> and never <hi>come down alive,</hi> but though they die <hi>lingeringly,</hi> yet <hi>certainly.</hi> Oh, that I might ſee their <hi>hands, feet, ſide,</hi> and <hi>every limb</hi> of the body of death bored, the <hi>head</hi> bowing, and the whole laid in the grave: the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, error, and vanity of the underſtanding; the ſinfull quietneſſe and unquietneſſe of my conſcience, the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of my will, the diſorder of my affections. 3. And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially, the ſoul makes uſe of the <hi>death</hi> of Chriſt as a <hi>motive</hi> or inducement to put it upon <hi>ſin-killing:</hi> Ah, my ſin is the knife (ſaith the ſoul) that is redded over in my Redeemer's blood: Ah, it pointed every thorn on his head, and nail in his hands and feet. Lord, Art thou a friend to <hi>Christ,</hi> and ſhall ſin that kill'd him, live? Thus a ſin-mortifying heart brings ſin <hi>neer</hi> to a <hi>dead</hi> Chriſt, whom faith ſeeth to fall a bleeding afreſh upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of ſin; and therfore it layes the death of Chriſt to the charge of ſin. The croſſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>ſins terror,</hi> the <hi>ſouls armour:</hi> The bloud of <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>old ſures-be,</hi> (as
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:166520:21"/>holy <hi>Bradford</hi> was wont to ſay) to kill ſin. As he died <hi>for</hi> ſin, ſo muſt we <hi>to</hi> it; as <hi>his fleſh</hi> was dead, ſo muſt <hi>ours</hi> be, <hi>Our old man is crucified with him,</hi> Rom. 6.6. Its not a <hi>Pope</hi>'s hallowing a <hi>Croſſe</hi> that can do it,
<note place="margin">Mr. D. Rogers Pr. Cat.</note> but the <hi>power of Chriſt</hi> by a promiſe, which <hi>bleſſeth</hi> this Croſſe to mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The ſoul labours to kill ſin by <hi>fruitfull enjoyment of Ordinances.</hi> It never goeth to <hi>pray,</hi> but it deſires ſin may have ſome wound, and points by prayer (like the <hi>ſick child</hi>) to the place where its moſt pained. How doth it <hi>bemoan</hi> it <hi>ſelf</hi> with <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and pour-forth the bloud of ſin at the eys? It thus alſo improves <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> it looks upon it as a ſeal to Gods promiſe, that ſin ſhall die: <hi>We being buried with</hi> Chriſt <hi>in baptiſm,</hi> that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſhall be <hi>drowned</hi> in the ſea. It never heareth a <hi>Sermon,</hi> but (as <hi>Joab</hi> dealt with <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rijah</hi>) it labours to ſet its ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>corruption</hi> in the fore-front of the battell, that when Chriſt ſhoots his <hi>arrows,</hi> and draws his <hi>ſword</hi> in the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Word,</hi> ſin may be hit. An <hi>unſanctified perſon</hi> is angry with ſuch preaching, and cannot endure the winde of a ſermon ſhould blow upon a luſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By a <hi>right improving all adminiſtrations of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:</hi> If God ſend any affliction, the ſanctified ſoul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that ſome <hi>corruption</hi> muſt <hi>go to the lions:</hi> If there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe any <hi>ſtorms,</hi> preſently it enquires for <hi>Jonah,</hi> and labours to caſt him over-board: If God ſnatcheth away <hi>comforts</hi> (as <hi>Joſeph</hi> fled from his Miſtris,) preſently a <hi>ſin-mortifying</hi> heart ſaith, Lord, <hi>thou art righteous,</hi> my unclean heart was prone to be in love with them more then with <hi>Chriſt</hi> my true Husband: If God at any time <hi>hedg up her way with thorns,</hi> ſhe reflects upon her own gadding after her impure Lovers: If her two eys <hi>(Profits, Pleaſures)</hi> be put out and removed, a <hi>ſin-mortifier</hi> will deſire to pull down the houſe upon the <hi>Philiſtims;</hi> and beareth every chaſtiſement cheerfully, even <hi>death</hi> it ſelf, that ſin may but die too.</p>

The ſoul thinks how happy it ſhould be, could it <hi>walk with God,</hi> and be upright, and enjoy <hi>Chriſt,</hi> be rid of a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> and be governed by the laws of a <hi>Liege,</hi> the <hi>Lord Jeſus.</hi> How heavie is Satans <hi>yoke</hi> to him who ſees the beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and taſts the liberty of <hi>holy obedience?</hi> A ſick man confined to bed, how happy doth he think them that can walk abroad about their imployments? Oh, (ſaith a gracious heart) how ſweetly doth ſuch a Chriſtian pray! how ſtrictly doth he live! how cloſe is he in duty! how fruitfull in converſing! But I (alaſs!) how feeble, how dead, how unable! I am held under by a tyrant; oh that I could be his death!</p>
                  <p n="6">6. By <hi>recollecting its former folly in loving of ſin:</hi> thinking thus; Formerly I loved that which now I ſee would have murdered me: What a deal of pains, care, coſt, time laid I out to ſatisfie my <hi>luſts!</hi> oh that I could <hi>recall</hi> theſe follies as I <hi>recollect</hi> them: but ſince I cannot make them never to have been, I'll labour to hinder them for time to come. Oh that my hatred might be greater then ever my love was to them. A ſoul that hath been <hi>mad upon</hi> ſin, afterward is as <hi>vehement againſt</hi> it. This is the Apoſtles argument, <hi>As ye have yeelded your members ſervants to uncleanneſſe,

A ſin-mortifying heart forbears the <hi>uſing</hi> of that which it hath heretofore <hi>abuſed;</hi> it knows that often Satan lieth in <hi>ambuſh</hi> behinde lawfull enjoyments.

Whereas a carnall heart <hi>engulfs</hi> it ſelf in occaſions of ſin (if in themſelves lawfull,) ſees no <hi>enemy,</hi> and therfore ſets no <hi>watch:</hi> he <hi>makes proviſion for the fleſh,</hi>

                  <p>For the explication whereof I ſhall briefly ſet down this Diſtinction, and theſe Concluſions.</p>
                  <p>All the Attributes of God are either 1. <hi>Eſſentiall;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Diſt.</note> which are the very <hi>divine Eſſence,</hi> and pertaining to the very <hi>nature of God,</hi> as to be a <hi>Spirit, omniſcient, eternall, true, good, powerful, mercifull,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Or, 2. <hi>Relative:</hi> And that, either 1. <hi>Inwardly,</hi> to the <hi>Perſons within</hi> themſelves; as for the <hi>Father</hi> to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get,</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> to be <hi>begotten,</hi> the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> to <hi>proceed</hi> from <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son.</hi> Or, 2. <hi>Outwardly:</hi> And that either 1. to the <hi>creatures,</hi> as to <hi>create, ſuſtain,</hi> &amp;c. or, 2. to the <hi>Church,</hi> as to <hi>redeem</hi> and <hi>ſanctifie,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Attributes that appertain to the Nature or Eſſence of God, are common to the three Perſons,</hi> as <hi>to be a Spirit,

(there being the ſame order of <hi>working</hi> in the Trinity, that there is of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting:</hi>) the <hi>Father</hi> works <hi>by</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> and the <hi>holy Ghoſt, ſending them,</hi> and <hi>not ſent by them;</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> works by the <hi>holy Ghoſt, ſending him from the Father</hi> into the hearts of beleevers, and is <hi>not ſent by him,</hi> but <hi>by the Eather:</hi> the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> works, and <hi>is ſent from the Father and the Son, not from himſelf.</hi> The works therfore of the <hi>Trinity</hi> are conſiderable, either <hi>abſolutely,</hi> or in regard of the works wrought, and ſo they are the works of the <hi>whole Trinity</hi> in <hi>common:</hi> Or <hi>relatively,</hi> when we conſider in what <hi>order</hi> the Perſons work, which Perſon works <hi>immediately,</hi> which by <hi>another.</hi> And ſo the <hi>Perſons</hi> are diſtinguiſh'd in their <hi>works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This conſidered, <hi>Jude</hi> in aſcribing <hi>Sanctification to God the Father,</hi> is eaſily reconciled to thoſe that aſcribe it to

                     <hi>God the holy Ghoſt, and the Son;</hi> theſe laſt named perſons being by <hi>Jude</hi> included in the <hi>working</hi> of ſanctification, and only the <hi>order of working</hi> of the bleſſed <hi>Trinity noted. The Father ſanctifying through the Son, by the holy Ghoſt; the Father ſanctifying by ſending the Son to merit, and giving his Spirit to work; the Son, by meriting; the holy Ghoſt by working our ſanctification, and immediately ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying us;</hi> in which reſpect he hath the title of <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>Sanctification</hi> moſt commonly expreſt as his work.</p>
                  <p>This for the Explication of the <hi>ſecond</hi> particular in the <hi>first</hi> priviledge of the faithfull to whom <hi>Jude</hi> wrote, viz. <hi>The Author of their ſanctification, God the Father.</hi>

To <hi>Man:</hi> and ſo <hi>mercy</hi> is (according to ſome) <hi>a grief of heart ariſing from the apprehenſion of anothers miſery:</hi> according to Scripture, <hi>Such a holy compaſſion of heart for the miſery of another, as inclines us to relieve him in his miſery.</hi> It is a <hi>compaſſion</hi> or ſympathy, becauſe it makes the mercifull heart a partaker of the <hi>miſery</hi> of him who is diſtreſſed; and therefore (ſay ſome) called <hi>miſericordia,</hi> becauſe <hi>it tranſlates the miſery of another into the heart of the merciful.</hi> And for this cauſe it is called the <hi>bowels of compaſſion,</hi> Col. 3.12. 1 John 3.17. Phil. 1.8. <hi>and</hi> 2.1. So likewiſe by the LXX. <hi>Pro.</hi> 12.10. And to <hi>have compaſſion</hi> is uſually ſet out in Scripture by a Verb that ſignifieth, <hi>to have the bowels moved,</hi> Mark 6.34. Matt. 14.14. and 15.32. Mar. 1.41. Luk. 7.13. &amp;c. becauſe <hi>mercy</hi> expreſſeth it ſelf in the <hi>bowels</hi> eſpecially; he that is affected vehemently with anothers ſufferings, having his very intrals and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els moved and <hi>rouled</hi> in him, (<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.8.) and is affected, as if the bowels of him that is in miſery were in his body: Nor is this Scripture compaſſion a <hi>fooliſh pity,</hi> whereby a man doth <hi>unlawfully</hi> tender him that is in <hi>deſerved</hi> miſery, as <hi>Ahab</hi> pitied <hi>Benhadad,</hi> and <hi>Saul Agag</hi> againſt Gods command; but ſuch a compaſſion as God <hi>approveth,</hi> a <hi>fruit of the Spirit,</hi> commanded and commended in the Word.

               <p n="1">1 Its a love of <hi>deſire</hi> to enjoy him for <hi>ours</hi> as the ſource of all our happineſs: The Soul loves God, under the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the <hi>greateſt good,</hi> and therefore puts forth it ſelf in ſtrongeſt deſires toward him.

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:166520:68"/>unity with the thing beloved, ſtirreth up a zeal to remove all obſtacles, worketh an <hi>egreſs</hi> of the Spirits, and as it were an <hi>haſte</hi> of the Soul to entertain and meet it: According to thoſe expreſſions of the Saints in Scripture, <hi>The deſire of our ſoul is to thy name:
<note place="margin">Eſ. 26.8 Pſ. 119.10.81 119.20 Pſal. 42.2 Pſal. 84.2</note> With my whole heart have I ſought thee: My ſoul fainteth for thy ſalvation. My ſoul breaketh for the longing it hath to thy judgements at all times. My ſoul thirſteth for God, I am ſick of love, &amp;c.</hi> Oh the vehement panting, breathing, and going forth of the ſoul of one toward God who is in love with him; he contemns the moſt ſerious worldly employments when he is taken up with this, and who ſo diſcourſeth with him of <hi>earthly concernments,</hi> ſpeaks as with <hi>one not at home; all the world</hi> not ſatisfying without the <hi>kiſſes of the lips</hi> of our beloved, our deſires being a thouſand times more for <hi>one ſmile</hi> of his face than for <hi>all the wealth</hi> under the Sun. No <hi>difficulty</hi> ſo <hi>great,</hi> no <hi>danger</hi> ſo <hi>imminent,</hi> nay no <hi>death</hi> ſo <hi>certain,</hi> which this love carries not through for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the thing beloved; this love being a falling mountain that breaks down all that ſtands betwixt it and the place of its reſt. In a word, no <hi>means</hi> ſhall be left <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed</hi> that by God are <hi>appointed</hi> for the obtaining of our beloved; enquiries <hi>of,</hi> or <hi>from</hi> others, how to find him; letters of love, ſighs, tears, ſobs, <hi>groans unutterable,</hi> are ſent to <hi>win</hi> him; deſires to <hi>hear</hi> again <hi>from him</hi> in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of grace are expreſſed.

It ſaith not (as <hi>Peter</hi> of his Tabernacles) <hi>Lord, Let there be one for me, and another for thee;</hi> but let us <hi>both</hi> be together <hi>in one.</hi> Its <hi>ever night</hi> with one who loves Chriſt till the <hi>Sun</hi> of his <hi>preſence</hi> be ariſing. He is like a certain kinde of Stone, of which ſome report, That if it be thrown into the water <hi>whole,</hi> it <hi>ſwims;</hi> if <hi>broken, it ſinks:</hi> he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver droops in any trouble, unleſs he apprehends a breaking between him and Chriſt. He is like the <hi>marigold</hi> that <hi>opens</hi> with the <hi>ſhining,</hi> and <hi>ſhuts</hi> with the <hi>ſetting</hi> of the Sun. His heart is lockt up in ſorrow when God <hi>hides his face,</hi>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:166520:69"/>and he cannot find another key fit to open it again among all the keyes in the houſe. What's <hi>all the world</hi> to him without the <hi>preſence of God</hi> but as a ſive pluckt out of the water? His comforts are <hi>only full,</hi> when <hi>God</hi> is in them. What are <hi>companions</hi> to him in whom he ſees <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> of God, but objects either <hi>irkeſome,</hi> or <hi>pitied?</hi> What are <hi>Ordinances</hi> unleſs with Chriſt, but as <hi>candles</hi> that have no light put to them? Nay, what would the <hi>joyes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> it ſelf be, if it were not for the <hi>preſence of God,</hi> but as a <hi>funeral feaſt</hi> or banquet where is much <hi>proviſion,</hi> but no <hi>chear.</hi>

Its a <hi>dead</hi> love to God that cannot ſtand unleſs it be <hi>ſhored up. True</hi> love will ſtand <hi>alone</hi> without politick props. To ſhroud our own <hi>private ends</hi> under the name of <hi>love</hi> to God, is not <hi>amicitia,</hi> but <hi>mercatura;</hi> not to <hi>love,</hi> but to <hi>make merchandize</hi> of him. The love that cannot be <hi>warm</hi> any longer than 'tis <hi>rubd</hi> with the warm clothes of preferment is but the <hi>carkaſſe</hi> of love. Then hath this love a <hi>ſoul,</hi> when <hi>God himſelf</hi> is the <hi>object</hi> of it, when 'tis not of <hi>what he hath,</hi> but of <hi>what he is;</hi> when he is beloved though we beg with him, or though all <hi>his</hi> Rings and Ornaments are pluckt off; nay, when he plucks off <hi>ours:</hi> In a word, all his <hi>wayes, ordinances, people,</hi> will have our love <hi>drawn out</hi> to them, for that of <hi>God</hi> which is imparted to them. The word will be received in its purity and power, <hi>moſt loved,</hi> when <hi>leaſt adulterated:</hi> when it diſcovers moſt of <hi>God to us,</hi> and moſt of <hi>ſin in us;</hi> when the <hi>deareſt</hi> corruption is <hi>ſtruck</hi> at, the <hi>cloſeſt</hi> duty <hi>urged,</hi> the <hi>ſecret</hi> corners of the ſoul <hi>ſearched,</hi> when the <hi>ſpiritual ſword</hi> is laid on with <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt blows:</hi> The perſons alſo in whom moſt ſhines the beauty of Gods likeneſs, we ſhall moſt be taken with; and thoſe ſhall have our love ſhine upon them, who can reflect nothing back again but holineſs.</p>

When Chriſt and the World meet (as it were) upon ſo narrow a bridge, that both cannot paſſe by, Chriſt ſhall go on, and the World ſhall go back. Chriſt in a Chriſtian ſhall have no Corrivals; as Chriſt beſtowes himſelfe wholly upon a Chriſtian, (wholly upon every one, as every line hath
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:166520:75"/>the whole indiviſible point) ſo a Chriſtian gives himſelfe wholly to Chriſt; he ſhares not his heart betwixt him and the world; <hi>all</hi> within him he ſets on work to love Chriſt, keeping nothing back from him, for whom all is too little. The greateſt worth that it ſees in any thing but <hi>Christ,</hi> is this, that it may be <hi>left for Christ;</hi> ever rejoycing that it hath any thing to which it may prefer him. To a ſoul in which is this love, <hi>Christ</hi> is as oyle put into a viall with water, in which (though both be never ſo much ſhaken together) the oyl will ever be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt; or as <hi>one riſing Sun,</hi> which drowneth the light of a numberleſſe number of <hi>Stars.</hi> It loves the world as alwayes about to leave and loath it; not as that <hi>for which</hi> it doth live, but as that <hi>without which</hi> it cannot live. The world hath not the top and ſtrength of it's affection; It loves nothing <hi>much,</hi> but him whom it cannot love <hi>too much.</hi> It lodgeth not the world in it's beſt room, and admits not ſuch a ſtranger into the <hi>cloſet</hi> of the heart, but only into the <hi>hall</hi> of the ſenſes.</p>

Every ſin by how much the nearer to it, by ſo much is it more deteſted by it. Of all ſins therefore its own have the deepeſt ſhare of hatred: for what it cannot remove,
<note place="margin">Rom. 7.

So to love it, as thereby to leſſen thy love to God; ſo to love it, as to be exceſſive either in grief for wanting it, or joy for having it, and to be over earneſt in uſing it, and injudicious in preferring it before thy God, is to love it unduely, and ſinfully: if at any time the creature be beloved innocently, 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved in and for God; as a pledge of heaven, as a ſpur to duty.</p>

Man doth but little, and it's counted much; God doth much, and it's counted little; and whence is this diſtemper'd eſtimate? Muſt mercy therefore be under-valued, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it comes from God?

Is any want ſo great, as to <hi>be nothing;</hi> or is any gift comparable to our <hi>very being?</hi> Children love their parents from whom they have their body, though <hi>they</hi> gave it not, but <hi>God</hi> by them. And what they <hi>did</hi> give, was not for love of their <hi>children,</hi> but <hi>pleaſure,</hi> and poſſibly they cauſed their childrens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings <hi>unwillingly;</hi> 'Twas not from any love in parents that <hi>theſe</hi> children were begotten rather than <hi>others,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was not in their <hi>choice,</hi> but when 'twas in Gods <hi>choice,</hi> ſeeing innumerable men, whom he could have made, he made <hi>theſe</hi> rather than <hi>others.</hi> What is it that ſhores and ſuſtaines our beings, but the prop of divine <hi>manutenency?</hi> Did God make the houſe, and then leave it to ſtand alone? Hath not the ſame power that <hi>ſet it up, held it up,</hi> ever ſince? hath he taken off that hand of ſuſtentation <hi>one</hi> moment ſince he built thee? Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and friends have loved thee, but was not all their affection <hi>a drop of Gods fountain?</hi> would not (elſe) their bowels have been <hi>flint</hi> and marble? and had not God bid them love thee, might they not have been upon <hi>choice,</hi> what ſome tender mothers are upon <hi>conſtraint, butchers</hi> inſtead of <hi>parents?</hi> The light of the Moon, and Stars in the night is from the Sun, though the Sun be not ſeen: ſo every benefit afforded by man is from God, though God be not obſerved.

Surely the giving of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the <hi>hyperbole</hi> of love, the <hi>higheſt note</hi> that ever love reached. A work that looks as if it were intended to draw out love from us.

What immeaſurable love was that wherby he was debaſed to our vileneſſe, that we might be advanced to his Majeſty, and whereby he ſuffered even beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and was never prodigall of any bloud but his own!

If God had required our <hi>Lands, and money,</hi> the <hi>poor.</hi> If <hi>Labour,</hi> and <hi>Travail,</hi> the <hi>ſick</hi> might have had his plea of exemption: but every one hath a <hi>Love,</hi> that hath a <hi>Soul.</hi> 3. <hi>This love which he requires, he beſtowed,</hi> and he calls for no more than his <hi>own:</hi> he doth but gather the grapes of his own <hi>Vine-yard;</hi> the Waters of his own <hi>Fountain;</hi> the fruit of his own Ort-yard: he requires no more than he firſt gives. 4. <hi>If it be beſtowed on him, he returns it much better than he received it.</hi> He purifies and appeaſeth it; removes its pain and impurity: he ſlayes nothing in it but the Ram: he makes it like to the Rain, which though the earth ſends up in thick and foggy va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, falls down in pure and ſilver ſhowers: or like to the waters which though they come from the ſea brack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and briniſh, yet return thither again in ſweet and Chriſtall ſtreams. God takes away the inordinateneſs, unholineſs, and ſenſualneſs of our love: he quiets and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſeth it, not emptying it of <hi>its honey,</hi> but only pulling out <hi>its ſting.</hi> Love being never unquiet, when in its center, or ſtinging when in the hive, or vexing the ſoul when ſet upon God. 5. <hi>In loving him, we do no more than we have ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our ſelves to do.</hi> We have choſen him for ours:

If twenty men <hi>love one another,</hi> every one <hi>as himſelf,</hi> every one is twenty, every one hath twenty hearts, forty hands, eyes, feet.

               <p n="1">1. In reſpect of their <hi>duty;</hi> they could never be too abundant in goodneſſe for him, from whom they were, and had, and did what ever was good. How could God dwell too much in the houſe of his own building? How could the Vineyard and Garden of his own plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting be too fruitfull? the Well of his own digging be too full? In their creation they received ſouls, bodies, faculties, ſenſes, with parts and members from him; in him alſo they <hi>lived,</hi> and <hi>moved,</hi> and <hi>had their being;</hi> and could they do him too much ſervice? In their redemption
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:166520:88"/>the delivery not onely from condemnation, but from <hi>vain converſation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.18.</note> and from the ſervice and corruption of ſin was aimed at by God; and not only a preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them <hi>to Heaven,</hi> but <hi>in holineſſe.</hi> In their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they were Chriſtians, and followers of Chriſt; And how could they walk too exactly, that had ſuch a guide? They had in the word, precepts, promiſes, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, examples; and how could they be too preciſe, that had ſuch a rule?</p>
               <p n="2">2. For their <hi>dignity.</hi> Holineſſe is a Chriſtians greateſt honour, and therefore the greateſt degree of holineſſe, the higheſt degree of honour. Grace is called <hi>glory,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.18.</note> and the more grace, the more glory. It's that which hath the moſt of Scripture-commendation. What an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable mention doth <hi>Paul</hi> make of the <hi>Romans,</hi> for <hi>having their faith ſpoken of throughout the world.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 1.8.</note> Our Saviour,
<note place="margin">Mat. 8.10. &amp;, 15.28.</note> that <hi>contemned the glorious buildings of the Temple,</hi> when his Diſciples ſhewed him them, <hi>admired a ſtrong faith</hi> more than once.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>For their further peace and comfort in this life.</hi> There's no abundance, but that of grace, which can content the poſſeſſour; the more <hi>holineſſe,</hi> the more <hi>enjoyment</hi> of him, <hi>in whoſe preſence is fulneſſe of joy.</hi> Whence is a Saints trouble, but from the deficiency of his graces? what is it that pincheth him, but the ſcantineſſe of theſe ſpirituall garments? the larger they are, the greater is his eaſe. He that hath <hi>true grace,</hi> may go to Heaven <hi>certainly;</hi> but he who hath <hi>ſtrong grace,</hi> onely goeth <hi>comfortably.</hi> A weak faith, a ſmall degree of love, patience, humility, will not carry a man joyfully through great troubles.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>For their future crown, &amp; further felicity in the next life.</hi> If any ſhall <hi>follow the lamb</hi> in whiter &amp; larger robes of glory than other; they are thoſe whom he hath adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt with the robes of grace here. If any ſhine brighter than others in <hi>heaven,</hi> they ſhall be thoſe who have been brighteſt in grace upon the <hi>earth.</hi> Though
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:166520:89"/>glory be not beſtowed <hi>for any merit</hi> in grace, yet I ſee no inconvenience to hold, that 'tis beſtowed <hi>according to the proportion</hi> of grace. If the more grace a Saint hath, the more he be <hi>fitted</hi> for glory,
<note place="margin">Col. 1.12</note> then the more grace he hath, the more (it is likely) he ſhall be <hi>filled</hi> with glory. The more the ſoul is widened with <hi>grace,</hi> the more capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious will it be of <hi>glory;</hi> the <hi>heavieſt crowns</hi> are fitteſt for the <hi>ſtrongeſt heads.</hi>

Laſtly, The Apoſtle deſired this multiplication of grace upon theſe Chriſtians, in reſpect of <hi>Himſelf.</hi> The holineſſe of the people, is the crown of the Miniſter, and the greater their holineſſe, the weightier, and more glorious is his crown. The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> had no greater <hi>joy</hi> than <hi>to ſee his</hi> ſpirituall <hi>children walk in the truth;</hi> The thriving of the child, is the comfort and credit of the Nurſe; the fruitfulneſſe of the field, the praiſe and pleaſure of the Husband-man; the beauty of the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, is the commendation of the Artificer; the health, fruitfulneſſe, and good plight of the flock, is the joy of the Shepherd. Miniſters are Husband-men, Nurſes, Artificers, Shepherds in Scripture phraſe: Nothing more troubles a godly Miniſter than to ſee his multiplied pains anſwered with a ſcanty proficiency; &amp; his <hi>double</hi> labour, with ſcarce a <hi>ſingle</hi> return of holineſſe. A gain-ſaying people is the <hi>grief</hi> of a Miniſter, that <hi>all the day long ſtretcheth out his hands;</hi> although it may be a ſweet mitigation of that griefe, to conſider that God will not reward his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters according to their <hi>ſucceſſe,</hi> but their <hi>ſincerity,</hi> and induſtry.</p>

               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Reaſons</hi> of the Apoſtles ſending this Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to theſe Chriſtians, or what it was that put him upon this profitable performance, of exhorting them in theſe words, <hi>Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common ſalvation, it was needfull for me to write unto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Exhortation</hi> it ſelf, in theſe words, <hi>And exhort you, that ye ſhould earneſtly contend for the faith which was once delivered to the Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Sundry weighty and unanſwerable <hi>Arguments</hi> to move the Chriſtians to follow and imbrace this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Exhortation, from the third, to the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>verſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Severall apt and holy <hi>Directions,</hi> to guide and teach theſe Chriſtians how to follow and obſerve the Exhortation, which he had back'd with the former ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, to the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>verſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I begin with the former: The <hi>Reaſons</hi> which put the Apoſtle upon ſending this following Exhortation: And the Reaſons (contained in theſe words, <hi>Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, it was needfull for me to write unto you,</hi>) are theſe three.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:166520:96"/>
1. The firſt is drawn from the <hi>dear love</hi> which the Apoſtle did bear to them: they to whom he wrote were <hi>beloved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond is drawn from the <hi>care and diligence</hi> of the Apoſtle for the doing of them good, and the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of their ſalvation; <hi>When I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common ſalvation:</hi> wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. With <hi>what mind</hi> and diſpoſition, he endeavoured their good, or how he was <hi>affected</hi> in endeavouring it; <hi>he gave all diligence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In <hi>what work</hi> he was imployed for their ſpirituall good, or by what <hi>means</hi> he endeavoured it; by <hi>wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Weightineſſe</hi> and great Concernment of that <hi>Subject</hi> about which he wrote, <hi>the common ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The third reaſon is taken from their <hi>need</hi> of having ſuch an Exhortation ſent to them; <hi>It was needfull for me to write unto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt reaſon is taken from the <hi>love</hi> which the Apoſtle did bear to them; They were <hi>beloved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the <hi>Explication</hi> whereof,
<note place="margin">Explicat.</note> two things are briefly to be opened.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What the word <hi>Beloved</hi> importeth, and what is contained in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Why the Apoſtle here beſtoweth this title upon them, calling them <hi>beloved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the firſt, the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>beloved,</hi> properly reſpects thoſe who have ſomething of excellency to draw out our love towards them;

                  </gap>, his <hi>beloved</hi> Son. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is by Greek Authours attributed to an <hi>only</hi> child: the <hi>Septuagint</hi> do with this word interpret that phraſe, <hi>Only Son,</hi> Gen. 22.2. <hi>Take thy Son, thine only Son:</hi> They tranſlate, <hi>take thy Son, thy beloved One.</hi> And <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. <hi>They ſhall mourn for him as one that mourneth for his only Son:</hi> they tranſlate, <hi>as one that mourneth for his beloved One:</hi> and others attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute this word to an <hi>only eye,</hi> as when a man hath but <hi>one</hi> eye, they call it a <hi>beloved</hi> eye.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the ſecond, <hi>why</hi> the Apoſtle beſtoweth upon them this title of <hi>beloved.</hi> He did it for two reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To ſhew what was his duty, not onely as a <hi>man,</hi> in which reſpect love is a debt due to all;
<note place="margin">Rom. 13.8.</note> or as a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> it being the duty of Chriſtians peculiarly to love Chriſtians, <hi>the houſhold of faith, brethren,
<note place="margin">John 13.34.</note> the members of one body, &amp;c.</hi> but eſpecially as an <hi>Apoſtle</hi> and <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi> What more ſutable than for a Father, a Nurſe,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.14, 15. 1 Theſ. 2.7, 8. John 21.</note> to love their children, a Shepherd his flock? The Apoſtles were ſpirituall <hi>Fathers, Nurſes, Shepherds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. To gain their loves by this affectionate Compella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Beloved:</hi> that they by obſerving his love to them, might both love him, and thereby more readily imbrace the following Exhortation. He is very uningenuous, who if he will not <hi>provoke</hi> love from an <hi>enemy,</hi> will not <hi>repay</hi> love to a <hi>friend.
<note place="margin">Mat. 5.46.</note> Even Publicans love thoſe who love them.</hi> The ſtone wall reflects heat, when the ſcorching Sun ſhines upon it. Love muſt be reciprocall; if we are to love thoſe who are friends to our <hi>bodies, estates, names, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Si diligis, fac quicquid vis.</note> are not they to be beloved much more who are our <hi>ſoul-friends?</hi> Nor was it more the <hi>duty</hi> of theſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, than their <hi>benefit,</hi> to love this holy Apoſtle. How
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:166520:97"/>much would their love to him, forward their love to his Miniſtery? Though the meſſage ſhould not be imbraced for the meſſenger, yet it's not ſo eaſily imbraced, unleſſe the meſſenger be <hi>beloved.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.14. Gal. 4.19. 1 Pet. 4.12. Phil. 1.8. &amp; 4.1. &amp; 2.12. Rom. 12.19. 1 Cor. 10.14. 2 Cor. 12.19. Heb. 6.9. Jam. 1.16.19. 1 Joh. 3.2.21.</note> That Miniſter who is beloved, hath a great advantage above another; he ſtands upon the higher ground for doing good; and this is the main reaſon that the Apoſtles ſo frequently call thoſe to whom they write, <hi>beloved.</hi> They did not deſire to inſinuate themſelves into the hearts of the Chriſtians for their <hi>goods,</hi> But for their <hi>good;</hi> not to ſet up <hi>themſelves,</hi> but <hi>Christ;</hi> they did not wooe for <hi>themſelves,</hi> but for the <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> they being his <hi>friends;</hi> they did not ſeek to advance <hi>themſelves,</hi> but their <hi>Meſſage,</hi> their <hi>Maſter.</hi>

By a flat prohibition of the act of diſſimulation, and of ſinfull ſerving mens humours. 2. By a moderation of exceſſiveneſſe in our expreſſions, which ſeem courteous. 3.

                  <hi>The work and labour of a Miniſter ſhould proceed from love to his people.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>loved</hi> them, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he <hi>wrote</hi> to them. Love ſhould be the fountain of miniſteriall performances. Firſt, Chriſt enquired of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters love,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 21.</note> and then he urged <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>labour.</hi> A Miniſter that <hi>ſpeaks with the tongue of men and Angels, and hath not charity, is as ſounding braſſe, and a tinkling cymball; though he have the gift of prophecy, and underſtand all myſteries, and all knowledge, and hath all faith; though he beſtow all his goods to feed the poor, nay, though he give his body to be burnt,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> and have not charity, he is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> God will not reward Miniſters according to what they <hi>have done,</hi> but according to what they have done in <hi>loving</hi> to do. Love is the marrow, the ſoul of every ſervice. All performances without love, are but cyphers
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:166520:97"/>without a figure, in Gods account they ſtand for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; they are ſacrifices without fire.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>People ſhould ſtudy to be fit for the love of their Paſtor.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 3.</note> To encourage him to love them; to be <hi>diligibiles,</hi> ſuch as theſe Chriſtians were, whom the Apoſtle called <hi>belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> A painfull Miniſter ſhould not only be put upon <hi>loving</hi> his people by <hi>conſcience of</hi> this duty, but by <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to</hi> this duty. Miniſters are often wrongful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complain'd of for want of love; All kind of love muſt not be afforded to all kind of people; a love of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy</hi> and <hi>complacency,</hi> muſt only be ſet upon the <hi>godly</hi> among his people. If a faithfull Miniſter be not ſuch to his offenſive unprofitable hearer as he <hi>would,</hi> 'tis becauſe this man is not ſuch to God, and his own ſoul, as he <hi>ſhould.</hi> How unworthy a part in any is it to make a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſter ſpend that time in weeping, complaining, reproving, which he had much rather ſpend in ſweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency, familiarity, and commendation!</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The love of a Miniſter muſt not be ſlack and remiſs,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 4.</note> but vehement and ardent.</hi> Miniſters are to imitate him in love, whoſe love was the moſt earneſt, who was the <hi>chiefe Shepherd,</hi> and had the chiefeſt care of his flock; who <hi>purchaſed it with his own bloud, Act.</hi> 20.28. who was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but love cover'd over with our fleſh.

Love alone can facilitate the difficulties of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters calling. Many things muſt be born, as the hatred, frowardneſſe, dulneſſe, weakneſſe of people; There muſt <hi>ubera</hi> be given, though <hi>verbera</hi> be returned;

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:166520:98"/>be lowly in doctrine and life, patient, laborious; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but love can make him be ſo. Every thing will be difficult to him that loves not. The object of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters love is the ſoul, the heaven-born ſoul, the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous eternall ſoul. <hi>What would it profit</hi> a Miniſter <hi>to gain the whole world, and loſe his</hi> peoples <hi>ſouls?</hi> The beaſt, the name, the body of a man muſt be beloved; much more his ſoul. The <hi>winning</hi> of ſouls is the <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> of a Miniſter.
<note place="margin">Gen. 14.21.</note> A Miniſter ſhould ſay of his eaſe, profit and pleaſure, as the King of <hi>Sodom</hi> to <hi>Abraham, Give me the ſouls, and take the goods to thy ſelfe.</hi>

                  <hi>The Loving of a Miniſters perſon, hath a great influence upon the loving of his doctrine.</hi> The Apoſtle knew this, when he deſired that theſe Chriſtians ſhould know that he loved them. It's the folly of people not to love the word, who ever be the ſpeaker. The <hi>meſſage</hi> hath not its commendation from the <hi>meſſenger;</hi> but the <hi>meſſenger</hi> from the <hi>meſſage.</hi> Yet rare is it to finde that Chriſtian, who thinks well of that counſell, which is given him by a Counſeller who is <hi>not beloved;</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is Satans policy to <hi>aſperſe</hi> the <hi>Miniſter,</hi> thereby to cauſe a diſlike of his <hi>Miniſtry.</hi> And great is their ſin, who by their un-amiable carriage, often make their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry abhorred, who either by prophaneneſſe, or unfit au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, confute with their <hi>life,</hi> what they perſwade with their <hi>lip.</hi> Some offend by <hi>prophaneneſſe,</hi> preaching per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſo holily in the pulpit, as ſome may almoſt think it pity they ſhould ever come out of it; yet when they are out of it, ſhewing ſo much levity, ſloth, worldlineſſe, looſeneſſe, as any would almoſt think it pity they ſhould ever go into it. Others offend by <hi>unmeet moroſity,</hi> not conſidering that a Miniſter muſt neither be all bait without hook, nor all hook without bait; as he muſt not by his flattery ſooth, ſo neither by auſterity affright his people. A Miniſter muſt not be a flaſhing Comet, but an influentiall Star; not a Storm, or a Tempeſt, but a ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dropping, bedewing Cloud.</p>

He robs Chriſt, who improves not the intereſt he hath in the hearts of his people for the honour of Chriſt. 'Tis not <hi>ſervice,</hi> but <hi>ſacriledge,</hi> to deſire the terminating of peoples loves in our ſelves. It's better (could it be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinne) that all ſhould <hi>hate</hi> us, than that they ſhould <hi>love us for our ſelves;</hi> for if all ſhould <hi>hate</hi> us, we ſhould have but what is our <hi>own;</hi> if they ſhould <hi>love us for our ſelves,</hi> we ſhould uſurp what is <hi>Chriſts.</hi> A Miniſters deſigne in being beloved by his people, ſhould be but to <hi>raiſe up ſeed to his elder brother:</hi> all his ſervices muſt be but ſcaffolds to erect a building of glory to Chriſt.

Love muſt be the eccho of love. It's often ſeen that they who love their people <hi>moſt,</hi> are beloved of them <hi>leaſt.</hi> In a ſpirituall ſenſe 'tis likewiſe true, that love <hi>deſcends</hi> more than it <hi>aſcends.</hi> And ordinarily, <hi>beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>poverty,</hi> is all the requitall which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned for the Jewell of <hi>Plain-dealing.</hi> People love not an <hi>eradicative,</hi> but a <hi>palliative</hi> cure of their ſpirituall diſtempers: Spirituall <hi>flatterers</hi> are commonly more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected than ſpirituall <hi>fathers.

               <p n="2">2. From this force and meaning of the words it may plainly be collected what kind of diligence this of the Apoſtle here was.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was a <hi>ſolicitous carefull diligence.</hi> He reſented the danger of theſe Chriſtians, and feared their ſpirituall loſſe and hurt by Satan, and his inſtruments. The care of theſe faithfull ones was upon him, as upon holy <hi>Paul, was the care of the Churches.
<note place="margin">Gal. 4.19. 2 Cor. 8.16. 2 Cor. 11.28.</note> Paul</hi> was <hi>afraid of the Galatians, of whom he travelled in birth till Chriſt was formed in them.</hi> Love is ever ſolicitous, doth its beſt, and fears the worſt. <hi>Titus</hi> had an <hi>earneſt care</hi> for the good of the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> and among them <hi>none was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, but Paul burned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It was a <hi>studious,</hi> and an <hi>intentive diligence.</hi> It ſet his head and heart a working to do them good. There was an earneſt and vehement application of both to this imployment. Faithfull Miniſters are laborious; they are peculiarly called labourers, and they <hi>labour in the word and doctrine. Paul laboured more abundantly than they all. Timothy</hi> was to <hi>ſhew himſelfe a workman.</hi> All their titles, as <hi>Fiſhers, Souldiers, Watchmen, Labourers, &amp;c.</hi> beſtowed upon Miniſters, commend <hi>Jude's</hi> diligence.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It was a <hi>chearfull willing diligence.</hi>

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:166520:100"/>This good worke was not done with an ill will.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It was a <hi>ſpeedy ready diligence;</hi> it was with a holy haſte. The Seducers were already <hi>entred among theſe Chriſtians;</hi> There was now no room for delayes. The beginnings of this miſchiefe were to be cruſh'd. While Miniſters are lingring, and doubting, Satan is devouring. They are ſouldiers, and Victory loves to flie upon the wing of <hi>Expedition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. It was his <hi>whole, utmoſt, entire diligence.</hi> Such a diligence as <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſeth he uſed, when he ſaid, <hi>As much as in me is,
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.15.</note> I am ready to preach the Goſpell.</hi> This work he made his buſineſſe, and to it he gave himſelfe; in compariſon of this his diligence for other things was but negligence. <hi>For three years he warned every one, night and day with tears, Act.</hi> 20.31. Nay, <hi>he was glad to ſpend and be ſpent,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.15. He was <hi>fervent in ſpirit,</hi> but in <hi>ſerving the Lord.</hi>

                  <hi>Common</hi> cannot be here taken according to the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the word ſomtimes in the Scripture, as 'tis oppoſed to <hi>holy,</hi> and as importing as much as <hi>prophane,</hi> or that which every one may uſe, or belongs to every one, as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.4. that bread which was not conſecrated to God, or hallowed, and of which any might eat, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>common.</hi> So <hi>Act.</hi> 10.14.28. and 11.8. Meats forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the Leviticall Law are called <hi>common and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,</hi> becauſe the prophane <hi>Gentiles</hi> did commonly uſe thoſe meats, which the <hi>Jews,</hi> being an holy people, might not eat.
<note place="margin">Heb. 10.29.</note> And ſo thoſe Apoſtates are ſaid <hi>to account the bloud of the Covenant a common,</hi> or <hi>unholy thing:</hi> they eſteeming the bloud of Chriſt no more, then if it had been the bloud of ſome ordinary perſon, or of ſome wicked or guilty one. Nor is <hi>common</hi> here to be taken unlimitedly, for that which is common univerſally to every one, as if none were excluded from this ſalvation.
<note place="margin">Mat. 7.14. <hi>Aug. de haereſ. cap.</hi> 43.</note> 
                  <hi>Origen</hi> is charged as if he held that thoſe who lived and died the moſt flagitious of ſinners; nay, that the divell himſelfe, and his angels, after a thouſand years torments, ſhould be ſaved.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Common</hi> is here taken in a limited ſenſe; this ſalvation being common only to the <hi>faithfull,</hi> who all have an intereſt in the ſame; it belongs to one of them,
<note place="margin">John 17.12. Rev. 7.9. Acts 1.8. Rom. 1.16.

               <p>And thus 'tis <hi>common ſalvation</hi> ſundry wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard of the <hi>meritorious purchaſer of this ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> There is one common Saviour,

1. It's <hi>common ſalvation,</hi> in regard of the <hi>rule and way, by which we are guided thither. There is but one faith,</hi> called alſo <hi>Catholick.</hi> God calls all his people with one voice.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Why</hi> doth the Apoſtle here call this ſalvation <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> writing to theſe Chriſtians?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some conceive that by ſhewing it was <hi>common to him,</hi> as well as to <hi>others,</hi> the ſurmiſe of his unfitneſſe to write of ſo weighty a ſubject, might be cut off. <hi>Jude</hi> would (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this opinion) ſhew that he writes, to them of no other ſalvation, but what he himſelfe in part underſtood, loved, expected with themſelves; and therefore he being an experienced Doctour, they ought the more readily to follow him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Others, as I apprehend more fitly, conceive, that the Apoſtle cals this ſalvation <hi>common,</hi> to prevent the ſelf-exemption of any particular Chriſtian from imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the following Exhortation, and Directions, which belong to the ſalvation of all: <hi>q. d.</hi> I write of the things which all have followed, that ever heretofore obtained ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and all muſt follow, who would not incurre their own ruine; therefore let every one embrace them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>God is moſt free of his beſt bleſſings.</hi>

                     <hi>Obſer.</hi> 1.</note> He affords ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in common to all his people. He gives honour and riches but to few of them; he gives Chriſt and heaven to them all. God ſomtimes denies a crumb, even to him
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:166520:108"/>on whom he beſtows a Kingdom. There are many things that a child of God cannot promiſe to himſelfe, but hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven he may reckon upon. There's no famine, where there is bread, though there be no plums and apples. And if God give ſalvation, though he denyeth theſe worldly toyes, there's no fear of famine. God gives thoſe things but ſcantily, which often hinder from heaven. He keeps nothing from his people, but what they may well be without: When the pooreſt Saint looks upon the greateſt Emperour in the world, he may ſay, though I have not the ſame <hi>worldly glory</hi> and wealth, yet I ſhall have the ſame <hi>heaven</hi> with him; only with this difference, I goe not thither with ſo much luggage on my back. It's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of the Duke of <hi>Hereford,</hi> when he was baniſh'd out of the Kingdom by <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, that he ſhould ſay, <hi>Well, yet I ſhall have the ſame ſun to ſhine upon me, that he hath who baniſheth me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſt and heaven are full and ſatisfactory;
<note place="margin">

And among thoſe people to whom Miniſters deliver this faith <hi>externally;</hi> ſome there are to whom it is delivered alſo <hi>effectually,</hi> by the internall revelation of the Spirit, which <hi>ſo</hi> delivers this doctrine of faith to all the Elect, that they themſelves are <hi>delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into it;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 6.17.</note> their underſtandings being ſavingly enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſee that excellency in it, which by the bare Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of it cannot be perceived; and their wils perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to imbrace it, as that rule of life according to which they will conſtantly walk.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>What need there was</hi> of the delivery of this faith.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard of the <hi>Inſufficiency of all other doctrines or preſcriptions in the world to lead to life.</hi> Only this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine delivered is the <hi>rule</hi> of faith and manners. <hi>Peace</hi> internall and eternall is only afforded <hi>to them who walk according to this rule.</hi>

This is the <hi>light</hi> which <hi>ſhines in a dark place;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.20.</note> to which who ever gives not heed, can never find the way to heaven. Learned <hi>Ethnicks</hi> never wrote of eternall happineſſe in their <hi>Ethicks.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.21.</note> The world by wiſdome knew not God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard of the <hi>totall inſufficiency of man to find out this doctrine of himſelf.</hi> The things delivered in this doctrine, are myſteries, ſupernaturall, and depending on the meer will and diſpenſation of God. The <hi>incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Son of God,
<note place="margin">Col. 1.26.</note> expiation of ſin by his death, juſtification by faith,</hi> could never have entred into the mind of man, unleſſe God had revealed them. They
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:166520:117"/>depend not upon any connexion of naturall cauſes. Though there be a kind of naturall <hi>Theologie,</hi> yet there's no naturall <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> Alſo the und erſtanding of man is ſo obſcured by the darkneſſe of ſin, that in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals it is purely blind. <hi>The naturall man perceives not the things which are of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.14.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This delivering of faith comprehends the <hi>keeping and holding it by thoſe to whom it was delivered.</hi> This is done therefore, 1. by <hi>Miniſters.</hi> 2. by <hi>every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. This duty is incumbent on <hi>Miniſters,</hi> who muſt keep the truth, <hi>hold faſt the faithfull word,</hi> and be tenacious,

               <p n="2">2. The faith is kept by <hi>every Chriſtian,</hi> by <hi>perſevering</hi> in the knowledge, love and practice of it. <hi>Every</hi> Saint muſt keep it in his head, in his heart, in his hand; this he muſt do, though for keeping the truth, he loſe his life. 'Tis not the <hi>having,</hi> but the <hi>holding</hi> the truth,
<note place="margin">Rev. 2.13.</note> which is a Chriſtians crown. He who lets it go, never had it truely and effectually in the love of it, nor ſhall ever enjoy it in the recompence of it. Of this more after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>

               <p>Three things may be touched in the Explication.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>meaning</hi> of the word <hi>once.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>agreement</hi> thereof with the <hi>delivery of faith,</hi> or <hi>how</hi> faith may be ſaid to be <hi>once</hi> delivered.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Why</hi> the Apoſtle adds this expreſſion, <hi>Once,</hi> to the delivery of faith, amplifying it this way.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>firſt,</hi> The word <hi>Once</hi> is taken two wayes in Scripture, and ordinary uſage.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As 'tis oppoſed to <hi>inconſtancy, deficiency,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Nullâ repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis arte laeſa pudicitia eſt, deperit illa ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel.</hi> Ovid.</note> ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or <hi>uncertainty of continuance;</hi> and ſo <hi>once</hi> is as much as <hi>firmly, conſtantly, irrevocably, alwayes.</hi> Thus God ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.36. <hi>Once have I ſworn by my holineſſe that I will not lie unto David;</hi> that is, my oath is <hi>irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable,</hi> nor is there any danger of <hi>inconſtancy.</hi> What I have ſworn, ſhall ſurely be accompliſh'd.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Once</hi> is taken as 'tis oppoſed to <hi>reiteration, repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> or <hi>frequency,</hi> either of the being, or doing of any thing; and ſo <hi>once</hi> is as much as <hi>once and no more; Once for all; Once, and not again; Once,</hi> and <hi>only once.</hi> When a thing is done ſo fully and perfectly, that it need not, or ſhould not, or cannot be done again. Thus <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28. <hi>Chriſt
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:166520:122"/>was offered once to bear the ſins of many.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. we read of the <hi>offering of Chriſt, once for all.</hi> And <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhai</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.8. deſired to <hi>ſmite Saul once,</hi> promiſing that he <hi>would not ſmite him the ſecond time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. For the <hi>ſecond,</hi> Both theſe ſignifications <hi>agree</hi> moſt apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſutably to the delivery of the doctrine of faith. For</p>
               <p n="1">1.

<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.25.</note> it <hi>endureth for ever.</hi> As the <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit</hi> of faith ſhall never ceaſe in the <hi>ſoul,</hi> ſo the <hi>doctrine</hi> of faith ſhall never ceaſe in the <hi>world.</hi> It's a candle, that all the winds of hell can never blow out; a flame, that all the waters of trouble can never extinguiſh. Thus it's called <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.6. <hi>the eternall Goſpel,</hi> never to be deſtroyed; it ſhall ever be in the Scripture, Miniſtry, hearts, and profeſſion of a number of men. <hi>My word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And the <hi>work of the Miniſtry,</hi> with the <hi>edifying of the body</hi> thereby, ſhall continue <hi>till we all meet, &amp;c. Epheſ.</hi> 4.13. That the doctrine of faith ſhall ever continue in <hi>one</hi> place, is not aſſerted; but that it ſhall ever, in <hi>ſome</hi> place, is certain. It's not for the dignity of Chriſt, the King of his Church, ever to ſuffer his Scepter to be wreſted out of his hands. It's not conſiſtent with the ſafety, integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, health, life, &amp;c. of the Church, in this her condition of conſtant exigency, to be deprived of the doctrine, which is given her for <hi>armour,</hi> a <hi>rule, medicine, food.</hi> It's as eaſie for enemies to pluck the Sun out of the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as this faith out of the Church. The whole power
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:166520:122"/>and policy of hell hath been imployed for that purpoſe ſixteen hundred years. Could it have been done, it had been done long before now.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The faith is <hi>once delivered,</hi> as <hi>once</hi> is oppoſed to <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency,</hi> or <hi>reiteration;</hi> it is <hi>once,</hi> and <hi>no more, Once for all, Once,</hi> and <hi>not again</hi> to be delivered, in reſpect it ſhall never be delivered again, with any change or alteration, which it is to receive.

2. The doctrine of ſalvation is <hi>once,</hi> i. e. <hi>unalterably</hi> delivered now, in reſpect of the <hi>preſent manner of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration;</hi> namely, by Miniſters, preaching, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp;c.

<note place="margin">Heb. 1.2.</note>

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Why</hi> doth the Apoſtle add this expreſſion <hi>once</hi> to the delivery of faith?

               <p n="3">3.

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:166520:126"/>Greek; to <hi>contend with all their ſtrength, extraordinarily, beyond meaſure, moſt earneſtly,</hi> do ſcarcely render the meaning of the word. More particularly, this extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and moſt <hi>eminent contention,</hi> importeth five things. 1. A <hi>ſerious and weighty cauſe and ground of contention.</hi> Men account not trifles worth <hi>any,</hi> much leſſe <hi>vehement</hi> ſtrife. The thing about which they contend earneſtly, is either weighty, or ſo eſteemed. 2. It importeth a <hi>conſiderable enemy to ſtrive with;</hi> not one who is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, but who requireth a great power to contend with him. 3. Some <hi>ſtrength and force whereby to deal with him.</hi> A child is not only unable to <hi>conquer,</hi> but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>contend</hi> with a Giant. 4. A <hi>putting forth of ſtrength againſt the enemy.</hi> Though a man be never ſo ſtrong, yet if he ſtands ſtill, and puts not out his ſtrength, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends not. 5. And laſtly, the <hi>contending after ſuch a manner as is conducible to a victory,</hi> and prevailing over the enemy with whom we contend; even the uſing of our utmoſt, beſt, and choyceſt endeavours; not a ſlight, but a ſerious and victorious contention.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From hence we may gather, <hi>what this earneſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention doth comprehend,</hi> which is here to be imployed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this faith.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It imports, that the fore-mentioned faith, is a <hi>ſerious and weighty ground,</hi> and a moſt conſiderable cauſe upon, &amp; for which to contend. What doth the Scripture more hold forth to be our duty, than to <hi>buy the truth,
<note place="margin">Prov. 23.23. Phil. 1.27. Rev. 3.10. Mat. 11.19.</note> and not to ſell it.</hi> To <hi>ſtrive together for the faith of the Goſpel;</hi> to be <hi>fellow-helpers</hi> to the truth; to <hi>keep the word of Gods patience;</hi> to be <hi>valiant</hi> for the truth; to <hi>juſtifie wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> &amp;c. Moſt precious is this faith to be contended for! <hi>firſt,</hi> even God himſelf was the fountain and founder of it, the Sun from which this ray of faith was darted; the Mine whence this faith, <hi>more to be deſired than the fineſt gold,</hi> was taken.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.10.</note> All the Princes of the world with all their combined bounties, could never have beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this faith upon the world. How precious is it <hi>ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:166520:127"/>in regard of the <hi>price</hi> of it, the death of Chriſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, not one promiſe of the word of life would ever have been made, or made good to our ſouls. How precious <hi>laſtly,</hi> in regard of the <hi>benefit</hi> of it; it doth all for us that God doth. For God affords by it, dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in our doubts,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.7, 8, 9. John 17.17. Rom. 1.16.</note> conſolation in our troubles, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in our fears, ſanctification in our filthineſſe, gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance to glory. In ſum, <hi>'tis the power of God to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> 'Tis not then a ſlight and triviall, but a moſt weighty and conſiderable cauſe, for which theſe Chriſtians were ſo earneſtly to contend, it being for the <hi>maintaining of the faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It implyeth and preſuppoſeth a conſiderable and <hi>ſtrong adverſary</hi> to contend with, in contending for the faith. The enemies with whom theſe Chriſtians were to ſtrive, were Sectaries, and ſoul-deſtroying Seducers; and Satan is the ring-leader, inſtructer, and aſſiſtant both of theſe, and all other forces raiſed againſt faith. <hi>We wreſtle not againſt fleſh and bloud</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>but againſt principalities and powers.

If the Captain be conquered, the common ſouldier will yeild. It's Satan who ſeduceth
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:166520:127"/>in Seducers. <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>afraid,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.3.</note> leſt as the Serpent beguiled Eve, the mind of the Corinthians ſhould be corrupted from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt.</hi> He is <hi>the enemy that ſoweth tares among the wheat, Mat.</hi> 13. And had not theſe Chriſtians in contending for the faith a <hi>conſiderable enemy?</hi> How could the Seducers want ſubtilty to <hi>creep in among</hi> theſe Chriſtians by their <hi>perſons,</hi> and <hi>into them</hi> by their <hi>opinions,</hi> into whom Satan the Serpent had crept before; nay, who now had the advantage of being the <hi>old Serpent?</hi> How eaſily could he flatter each humour,
<note place="margin">Rev. 12.9.</note> propound ſutable luſts to every pallate; clothe and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour every hereſie and luſt with plauſible titles, Chriſtian Liberty, new Lights, rare Notions; oyle and butter over wicked practices, and do much with ſweet words, cunning and doubtfull expreſſions? What powerfull ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries were theſe ſeducers,
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.2.</note> who had the <hi>Prince of power,</hi> the <hi>ſtrong man armed,</hi> the <hi>god of this world</hi> to help them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How could they want malice, and cruelty, who were aſſiſted by the enemy of ſouls, the <hi>deſtroyer,</hi> the <hi>roaring lyon,</hi> the <hi>red dragon?</hi> How could they want di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and activity, who had the divell to drive them; him to inſtigate, whoſe motion in ſin is his reſt; who <hi>walketh about, ſeeking whom he may devour?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. This earneſt contention imports a <hi>conſiderable ſtrength, wherby to contend</hi> for the faith againſt ſo potent an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. Every ones ſtrength is in it ſelf but weakneſs; the ſtrongeſt are not of themſelves able to ſtand before the weakeſt tentation. Our ſtrength is then from our Head, our <hi>Captain Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who beſtoweth upon us ſuch ſupplies of grace, as that we are never fully and finally foyled, but in and with him overcome all, as the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting, ſo the enticing world. More particularly, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth this ſtrength to us two wayes. 1. On <hi>his part,</hi> he ſendeth his Spirit to <hi>beſtow</hi> upon us. 2. On <hi>our parts,</hi> he enables our faith to receive from him the ſupplies of his ſtrength.</p>
               <p n="1">1. On <hi>his part,</hi> he <hi>beſtowes</hi> his Spirit to ſtrengthen us.
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:166520:128"/>This his Spirit doth two wayes, 1. By <hi>working.</hi> 2. By <hi>ſtrengthening</hi> our union with Chriſt. 1. In the <hi>former,</hi> the Spirit conveyeth a principle of <hi>ſpirituall life</hi> and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,
<note place="margin">1 John 3.9.</note> putteth into us a <hi>ſeed</hi> that ſhall never <hi>die;</hi> and infuſeth an habit of holineſſe never to be loſt, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.
<note place="margin">Phil. 1.19. Epheſ. 3.16. Epheſ. 6.10.</note> 2. In the <hi>latter,</hi> it affordeth thoſe continued ſupplies of grace, whereby we are more and more <hi>ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with might</hi> to reſiſt all tentations, go through all conflicts; to find preſervation and direction in every danger and doubt; to walk in daily deteſtation of every ſinfull way; to call and cry for grace which is wanting; and in a word,
<note place="margin">Phil. 4.13.</note> enabled to <hi>do all things through him who ſtrengtheneth us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. On <hi>our parts,</hi> he enables our faith by his Spirit to receive from him the ſupplies of his ſtrength. This he doth by giving a power to faith. 1. To <hi>unite us</hi> unto, and to incorporate us into him, as the branches are in the tree, the member in the body, or the houſe upon the foundation. We laying hold upon him for ours by our faith, as he layeth hold upon us for his by his Spirit; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the union is compleat and reciprocall. 2. To <hi>improve this union</hi> for our aſſiſtance, by drawing daily influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of grace and ſtrength from Chriſt, who is a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of fulneſſe,

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:166520:128"/>pipe without water.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Miniſters</hi> muſt <hi>contend for the faith,</hi> principally two wayes.</p>

               <p n="2">2. By <hi>confuting gainſaiers and hereticks.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle commands <hi>Titus, by ſound doctrine to convince gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Every Chriſtian ſhould contend for the faith.</hi> Every child of wiſdome ſhould <hi>juſtifie</hi> their parent. Saints muſt <hi>ſtrive together for the faith of the Goſpel.</hi> And this they muſt do ſundry wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By <hi>praying for the ſucceſs of the faith againſt errour. They muſt pray, that God would ſend forth labourers into his harveſt; That utterance may be given to</hi> Miniſters,

                  <hi>that they may ſpeak boldly as they ought to ſpeake. That God would open unto them a door of utterance. That the word of the Lord may run and be glorified.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. by <hi>encouraging thoſe</hi> againſt whom Satan bends his greateſt force and fury in this Conflict about faith. <hi>They muſt know thoſe who labour among them,
<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5.12.</note> esteeming them very highly in love for their works ſake.</hi> When the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Miniſters grows hotteſt, the love of people muſt not grow coldeſt. What proportion doth money bear to faith; what is gold but dung to religion? How juſt is it that they who will not part with their money for the truth, ſhould part with money and truth too! and that they who will not pay the Scripture Seſsment, to <hi>honour God with their ſubſtance, to buy truth,</hi> &amp;c. ſhould have all ſwept from them <hi>by oppreſſors!</hi> No ſouldiers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſo much to have the oyl of love drop'd into their wounds, as thoſe who received them in contending for the faith: No ſcarrs are ſo honourable as thoſe gotten in this conflict. Never did kiſſing better become an Emperor, than when <hi>Conſtantine</hi> kiſſed the hollow of holy <hi>Paph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius</hi>'s eye; whoſe war having been ſo holy, made his ſcar honourable.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By <hi>mutuall exhortation.</hi> Chriſtians muſt incite one another to the ſpirituall conflict,
<note place="margin">Heb. 10.24. Mat. 3.16.</note> 
                  <hi>ſpeak often one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> for the ſtrengthing of their reſolution, and the whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their zeal; for the blowing up their love to God.

               </p>
               <p n="5">5.

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:166520:130"/>juſtifie our faith. A dumb faith is not a <hi>divine</hi> faith,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.15, 16. Mat. 10.32.</note> but the faith of <hi>divels.</hi> Hypocrites will confeſſe Chriſt in times of encouragement, but not of contradiction. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian hath no cauſe to be aſhamed of his name, of his Livery, his Maſter. He who will <hi>confeſſe Chriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Maledicta ſit humilitas quae huc ſe demiſerit.</hi> Luth.</note> when <hi>most</hi> deny him, ſhall be <hi>confeſſed by Chriſt,</hi> when he ſhall deny <hi>most.</hi> This is the only holy kind of boldneſſe; and curſed is that modeſty, which makes us aſham'd of our Maſter.</p>
               <p n="6">6. By <hi>ſuffering for the faith.</hi> A Chriſtian is never ſo like a ſouldier, or himſelf, as when he <hi>confeſſeth the faith</hi> he hath, and <hi>ſuffereth</hi> for the faith he confeſſeth.

Would Saints but betray the faith, all <hi>Satans</hi> conteſts with them would be at an <hi>end,</hi> but then <hi>Gods</hi> would <hi>begin;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 2.13.</note> and though God be the <hi>ſweeteſt friend,</hi> yet is he the <hi>ſoreſt enemy.</hi> How kindly doth God take it when we <hi>hold faſt his name,</hi>

                  <item>2 <hi>Spirituall judgements are ever the ſoreſt.</hi> In Gods withdrawing his grace, and delivering up to a reprobate ſenſe, there is ſomething of <hi>Condemnation.</hi> The ſoul of a judgement is its ſeizing upon the ſoul. The greateſt miſery which can befall the body, is but for the ſoul to leave it: and what proportion bears this to the miſery of Gods leaving the ſoul! The death in death is the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage of the ſoul. If a man be not heart-ſick, though otherwiſe diſtempered, he is not feared; and if not ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and the union between God and him weakned, there is no danger. Bodily miſeries are but appearing and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinionative, and there is a vanity in outward trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles as well as enjoyments. The Apoſtle makes the greateſt ſuffering of the body to be but <hi>as ſuch,</hi> rather a dream then a reality of ſuffering. The pooreſt Saint never had a drop of condemnation in a ſea of cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.

He who dares not wade to the ancles, is in no danger of being ſwallowed up in the depths. Modeſt beginnings make way for immodeſt proceedings in ſin. The thickeſt ice that will bear a cart, begins with a thin trembling cover that will not bear a pibble. As theſe Seducers crept in by degrees into the Church, ſo did Satan by degrees creep into them;

<note place="margin">1. <hi>q.</hi> 23. <hi>Art.</hi> 5.</note> they conſider <hi>Reprobation,</hi> with <hi>Aquinas</hi> and other Shoolmen, either in reſpect of the <hi>act</hi> of God reprobating, Gods <hi>willing</hi> and <hi>decreeing;</hi> or in reſpect of the effect thereof, the things willed or decreed, as God wills <hi>that one thing ſhould be for another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. As to <hi>Reprobation</hi> in reſpect of the act or <hi>decree of Gods reprobating,</hi> or Gods willing or decreeing; they ſay, the ſins of the creature cannot be aſſigned as the cauſe of reprobation;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Non eſt aſsig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare cauſam di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinae voluntatis ex parte actus volendi.</hi> Aquin ubi ſupr.</note> and herein they agree with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas</hi> and the ſounder Schoolmen. They conceive that the decree of reprobation was not without the fore-ſight of ſin; Yet that the ſight of ſin was neither in order of nature or time, before <hi>Reprobation,</hi> nor after it; but purely, evenly, and equally accompanying it. That Gods decree to permit ſin (from whence comes previſion
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:166520:151"/>of ſin) and to condemn for ſin, were not the one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to the other, or of a diverſe order; as if the one were the <hi>end,</hi> and the other the <hi>mean;</hi> but co-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and of one and the ſame order and means, both accommodated to one and the ſame end: God neither condemning that ſin may be permitted, nor permitting ſin, that he might condemn; but permitting ſin, and condemning for ſin, that the glory of his juſtice might be manifeſted; the glorious manifeſtation of his juſtice being not advanced only by permiſſion of, or only by condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for ſin, but by both joyntly, or together; according to which apprehenſion, ſinne <hi>fore-ſeen</hi> could not bee the cauſe of <hi>Reprobation.</hi> They conceive, that God not depending upon any condition in the creature, no other way fore-knew the futurition of ſin, than by his own decree to permit it. And they further urge, if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of ſinne, were before Gods decree of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, then the decree of permiſſion of ſin ſhould have been before the decree of Reprobation; and ſo God ſhould intend the permiſſion of ſin, before he intended the damnation of man for it; and then it would follow, (in regard that what is firſt in intention, is laſt in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) that damnaton for ſin ſhould be in execution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the permiſſion of ſin, for which men are damned; And this is the Argument oft urged by D. <hi>Twiſs;</hi> to which he ſometimes adds, that whatſoever is firſt in <hi>intention,</hi> hath the nature of an <hi>end,</hi> in reſpect of that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes it; but the permiſſion of ſin cannot be conſidered as an <hi>end</hi> in reſpect of the damnation of men, it being impoſſible that men ſhould be damned to this end, that ſin ſhould be permitted. And they of this opinion aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, that if becauſe God decreed, that condemnation ſhall onely be for ſin, it followes that ſin is a cauſe of that decree; it will alſo unavoidably follow, becauſe God hath decreed, that ſalvation ſhall onely be in a way of <hi>good works,</hi> that good works are a <hi>cauſe</hi> of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree; they conceiving that though good works do not
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:166520:152"/>go before ſalvation with the ſame efficacity, wherein ſin goeth before damnation (<hi>good works</hi> being only <hi>diſpoſitive</hi> cauſes of the one, and <hi>ſins meritorious</hi> cauſes of the other) yet that they go before it,

               <p n="2">2. As to <hi>Reprobation</hi> in regard of the <hi>effect</hi> (or rather conſequent thereof) the things decreed and willed, or as God wills that one thing ſhould be for another, It is not doubted, albeit Gods eternall volitions or decrees, depend not upon any temporall object or cauſes, as the prime motives therunto, but that God by his eternall decree ordained, that this or that event in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall execution, ſhall not follow but upon this, or that going before; as, that in thoſe of years, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall beſtowing of eternall life, ſhall depend upon beleeving; repenting and perſevering, and that the actuall puniſhing with eternall death ſhall depend upon finall unbelief and impenitency. This is not to make the eternall decrees of Election and Reprobation dependent upon the fore-ſeen contingent Acts of mans freewill, but to make temporall events, <hi>Acts,</hi> or <hi>Things,</hi> one to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend conditionally upon another, for their being or not being in time.</p>
               <p>And yet 1. The <hi>cauſe</hi> of <hi>Reprobation,</hi> in reſpect of <hi>denying of grace,</hi> external, whether in regard of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means; or internall, either common or ſaving, is the <hi>will and pleaſure of God.</hi> As it is the meer will and pleaſure
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:166520:152"/>of God whereby in <hi>time</hi> men are reprobated from grace, was from <hi>eternity;</hi> for as God doth, or doth not in <hi>time</hi> ſo it he purpoſeth to do or not to do from all <hi>eternity.</hi> Now, that in time the <hi>denyall of grace</hi> is from the <hi>will and pleaſure</hi> of God, is moſt evident from Scripture, which teacheth that God calls to grace, and gives the very means of ſalvation to whomſoever he will.

It hinders not the uſe of the holy indeavors which God requireth of thoſe who expect happineſs, and would ſhun wretchedneſs. Mans induſtry muſt not ceaſe, about things or ends determined by Gods abſolute unrevealed decree. Though our endeavours doe not make the end otherwiſe <hi>quoad eventum,</hi> then God did fore-determine it, yet it was ſo determined by God, as that it ſhould never bee acquired without the uſe of our indeavours. God doth not by the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute decree of Election abſolutely determine to ſave us, whether we beleeve or not beleeve, repent, or not repent. And therefore Faith and Repentance are not to be rejected; nor doth he by the abſolute decree of Reprobation determine to damne any whether they believe,

                  <p n="1">1.

But alas, that men do quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in a ſpirituall reſpect, they throng after the world, which makes them <hi>pay</hi> for what they have <hi>dearly,</hi> and neglect Chriſt who <hi>offers</hi> all they want <hi>freely.</hi> Why is it that <hi>the Kingdom of heaven ſuffers</hi> not more <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</hi> The world is not bread, and yet it requires mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; Chriſt is bread, and requires nothing but a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack! Pity thoſe, who <hi>for lying vanities forſake their own mercy.</hi> Call others to partake of this grace with thee: <hi>Eat not thy morſels alone.</hi> Say, as thoſe lepers did, <hi>This is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace.</hi> Haſt thou received this grace, wiſh all men were like to thee, <hi>thy ſins</hi> only excepted. When beggers have fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red well at a rich mans door, they go away, and by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it, ſend others: Tell to others how free an Houſ-keeper thy God is; ſo free that he moſt delights in comers and company.</p>
                  <p>This for the <hi>kind</hi> or <hi>nature</hi> of the enjoyment, which theſe ſeducers <hi>abuſed; Grace.</hi> The <hi>owner</hi> thereof, <hi>whoſe</hi> grace <hi>it was</hi> follows; call'd here by the Apoſtle <hi>our God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Explication, I ſhall (briefly) ſhew two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>What it is</hi> for God to be <hi>our God;</hi> or what theſe words <hi>our God</hi> import.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Why</hi> the Apoſtle here mentioning the grace abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:166520:167"/>by ſeducers, cals it not ſimply the grace of <hi>God,</hi> but the grace of <hi>our</hi> God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>What it is</hi> for God to be <hi>our God.</hi> In this, <hi>three</hi> things deſerve a large explication, which I (to avoid te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſſe) ſhall but touch. 1. <hi>Wherein the nature of this propriety conſiſts,</hi> or what kind of propriety it is. 2. <hi>What</hi> there is <hi>of God</hi> in which the faithfull have an intereſt and <hi>propriety.</hi> 3. <hi>How ſutable</hi> and beneficiall <hi>a good,</hi> this God is to thoſe who have this intereſt and propriety in him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the <hi>nature of this propriety</hi> in God. God may be ſaid to be <hi>ours,</hi> and we may be ſaid to have a <hi>propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in him</hi> by a threefold right. 1. By a right of <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and thus he is the God of heathens, of divels, of all creatures;
<note place="margin">Acts 14.17, 18. Acts 17.28, 29</note> they being <hi>all the work of his hands,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving from him <hi>life, being,</hi> and <hi>motion.</hi> 2. By a right of <hi>externall profeſſion,</hi> or federall ſanctity; and thus God is often called <hi>the God of Iſrael;</hi> and in reſpect of this, the <hi>Jewes</hi> are ſaid to be the <hi>children of the Kingdom.</hi> 3. By <hi>peculiar grace,</hi> and ſaving intereſt through Chriſt; and thus only believers who are really united to Chriſt by faith,
<note place="margin">Jer. 31.31.</note> have a propriety in him, with whom God hath covenanted that he will be their reconciled friend and father, pardoning their ſin by Chriſt, <hi>putting his law into their inward parts, &amp; writing it in their hearts,</hi> that <hi>he wil be their God, and that they ſhal be his people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the ſecond. The faithfull have a propriety in <hi>all of God</hi> they can <hi>want</hi> or <hi>wiſh.</hi> Particularly, 1. In all the <hi>three Perſons</hi> of the Godhead.
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.6. John 17.12. 2 Pet. 1.3.</note> The <hi>Father accepts them</hi> for his in his <hi>beloved;</hi> nay, he <hi>gave them to Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>choſe them before the foundation of the world.</hi> The Father of Chriſt is their Father, to provide for, pardon, and govern them, and to afford them <hi>all things which pertain to life and godlineſſe.</hi> The <hi>Son</hi> is their Mediatour, their head,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.5. Col. 1.18. 1 Theſ. 1.10.</note> their brother, their husband; they are his by the Spirit, and he theirs by faith; he delivers them from all the evill they fear; he obtains for them all the good
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:166520:167"/>they deſire. The <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is theirs,
<note place="margin">John. 14.16.</note> to direct and teach them, to purifie and cleanſe them, to furniſh and adorn them, to ſupport and comfort them.
<note place="margin">1 Theſ. 1.10.</note> 2. They have a propriety in the <hi>attributes</hi> of God. In his <hi>omniſcience,</hi> he knowing whatſoever they want, or hurts them. In his <hi>wiſdome,</hi> to teach and guide them. In his <hi>power</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and defend them. In his <hi>love</hi> to delight in, pity, and provide for them. In his <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi>

In his <hi>al-ſufficiency,</hi> to ſupply and furniſh them with all needfull bleſſings, according to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very want. One God anſwers to all exigences. 3. They have a propriety in his <hi>promiſes, great and precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,</hi> wherein all they want, and infinitely more than they can conceive, or deſire, is aſſured to them, grace, glory, mercies for the throne, and the footſtool; nay, God himſelfe, in whom all bleſſings are ſummed up, and center'd; all being as certain, as if already perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; and for the accompliſhment whereof, they have Gods oath, wherein he hath (as I may ſay) pawn'd his very being; and the ſeal of the bloud of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Heb. 6.17.</note> that being the <hi>bloud of the Covenant,</hi> and he the Mediatour of the Covenant,
<note place="margin">Heb. 12.24. 2 Cor. 1.20.</note> 
                     <hi>in whom all the promiſes are yea and amen.</hi> 4. They have a propriety in the <hi>providences</hi> of God, whereby whatſoever may hurt them, is withheld from them; not <hi>an hair of their head</hi> ſuffered to <hi>periſh;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 10.30.</note> and they, though poor, perſecuted, ſick, dying, yet ever ſafe; nay, whereby whatever befals them, ſhall be beneficiall to them; every ſtone thrown at them, made a precious ſtone; every twig of every rod ſanctified; the iſſue of every diſpenſation made ſweet and beautifull. In a word, whereby they are enabled to be, and do, and bear, what-ever God either commands, or impoſeth; and they relieved with what-ever may do, or make them good.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For the <hi>third,</hi> how <hi>ſutable and beneficiall a good God is to thoſe who have a propriety in him.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 4.24.</note> 1. He is a <hi>ſpirituall good;</hi> droſſie and earthy comforts ſute not

                     <note place="margin">Jer. 10.5.</note> The creature is a dead, liveleſs, lumpiſh, unactive thing; it may be ſaid of it as 'tis of an <hi>Idol, it muſt be born, becauſe it cannot goe.</hi> We rather <hi>uphold it,</hi> than it <hi>upholdes us.</hi> Like <hi>Baal, it is not able to plead for it ſelfe.</hi> It helps us not in diſtreſs of conſcience, the <hi>day of wrath.</hi> Like <hi>Abſaloms mule,</hi> it goeth from under us, and leaves us in our diſtreſſes; but God relieves the ſoul, and affords <hi>ſtrengthning conſolation.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 6.18.</note> He <hi>is a preſent help in the needfull time of trouble;</hi> and ever either <hi>preſerves us from,</hi>

He is an <hi>abſolute, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent good.</hi> He is ſelf-ſuficient. <hi>If he be hungry, he will not tell thee.</hi> He depends no more upon the <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> than the <hi>fountain</hi> upon the <hi>ſtream.</hi> He is not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from helping us by any deficiencies of the creature he hath ſomtime complained, that he hath had <hi>too many,</hi> never that he hath had <hi>too few</hi> to deliver by. How ſafe is it to depend upon him, who depends upon none! 4. He is an <hi>unmixed good,</hi> and hath nothing in him but goodneſs. He is an <hi>ocean</hi> of ſwetneſs, without a <hi>drop</hi> of gall.
<note place="margin">Cant. 5.16.</note> He is <hi>altogether lovely,</hi> and a beauty without any ſhadow. There is nothing in him that the ſoul could ſpare, or wiſh were abſent.

<note place="margin">Luke 12.33.</note> the more he pleaſeth the enjoyer. 5. He is <hi>an indeficient, never failing good;</hi> a fountain which the hotteſt ſummer dryes not, a treaſure never empty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, one whoſe perfections never leave himſelf, and one who never leaves any that ever truly enjoyed him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6. Laſtly. He is a moſt <hi>full good,</hi> and that in <hi>two</hi> reſpects. 1. In reſpect of the comprehenſiveneſs, or the fulneſs of the <hi>object.</hi> In one God is every thing. He is a bundle
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:166520:168"/>of all perfections. All the diſperſed excellencies in the world are aſſembled in him. When he ſaith, <hi>I will be thy God,</hi> there's as much ſaid as can be ſaid. And as we can have nothing better than God, ſo of good we can have nothing more. 2. He is a <hi>full good</hi> in regard of <hi>contentment,</hi> or fulneſs of the <hi>ſubject:</hi> whoever hath an intereſt in him, hath that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that abundant plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which obſerved, will not ſuffer him to envy the moſt proſperous ſinner: God can fill the vaſt, capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſoul, like thoſe <hi>water-pots of Galilee,</hi> up <hi>to the very brim.</hi> He hath enough for himſelf, and needs muſt he then have enough for us. The water which can fill the ſea, can much more fill a cup.
<note place="margin">Jer. 31.14.</note> 
                     <hi>My people ſhall be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with goodneſs, ſaith the Lord. My God ſhall ſupply all your need.</hi> The tongue, the wiſh, the conception,
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.19.</note> all fall ſhort of God. In heaven, though we ſhall comprehend ſo much as we <hi>want,</hi> yet not ſo much as <hi>he is.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>ſecond branch</hi> of Explication, was, why the Apoſtle, here mentioning the grace abuſed by theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers, calls it, <hi>the grace of</hi> OUR <hi>God.</hi> This he doth <hi>to make the fact</hi> of theſe Seducers in abuſing it, the <hi>more odious</hi> among theſe Chriſtians. Diſhonour offered to God, deeply affects the ſoul of one who hath a propriety in God. Our <hi>own</hi> child, ſervant, houſe, nay beaſt, or a poorer thing, if it be <hi>our own,</hi> we ſuffer not to be wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and much more doth our propriety in God make every thing which diſhonours him, hatefull to us. And that upon two grounds; 1. As he is <hi>our God who loves us,</hi> takes us into covenant, and owns us. Holy inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity will conſtrain us to love that grace which ſaved us, that God who loved us freely when we were unlovely, who loved us abundantly, beſtowing his very ſelf, and in himſelf all things, and who continues thus to love us e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally. 2. As he is <hi>our God whom we have taken by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to</hi> be <hi>ours,</hi> to love and ſerve for ever. Now 'tis both againſt fidelity and inbred generoſity to ſuffer that
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:166520:169"/>thing to be abuſed, which we have undertaken to ſerve. This neither agrees with honeſty, nor honour; 'tis not only a <hi>ſin,</hi> but a <hi>ſhame.</hi> Hardly is any ſervant ſo low ſpirited, as to think it conſiſtent with his credit to <hi>ſerve an abuſed,</hi> a diſgraced <hi>Maſter:</hi> but eſpecially are all people tender of the honour of <hi>the God</hi> whom they have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to <hi>ſerve.</hi> The <hi>Philiſtims tread not on the thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold</hi> upon which their god <hi>Dagon</hi> did fall.

<note place="margin">Phil. 4.13. Pſal. 25.4. &amp; 5.9.

In a word, when they die, he neither ſuffers them to lie ſtill, nor ſends them to ſeek another maſter; for then they change not their maſter for another, but their work for a better, or rather for their wages. For 5. No Maſter ever <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded</hi> his ſervants ſo <hi>bountifully.</hi> As Chriſt gives more for, ſo more to his ſervants than any maſter. That happineſſe which Chriſt gives his ſervants in <hi>this life</hi> is unſpeakable; their work ſeems to have more of wages than work: but in the <hi>next life,</hi> their joy will be ſo great, as that it cannot ſo well be ſaid to <hi>enter into them,</hi> as they to enter into it.
<note place="margin">Mat. 25.21.</note> For why? it is <hi>the joy of their Lord,</hi> whoſe boſome is the hive and center of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and that in which all the ſcattered parcels of bleſſedneſſe are bundled up. Study, but yet expect not

Now think, O Chriſtians, what an heinous ſin it is to deny that <hi>being,</hi> which thine own proves; nay, to hear, to ſpeak of God, to plead for God, to pray to God ſo frequently, and (in appearance) feelingly, and yet to <hi>deny</hi> that this <hi>God is.</hi>

For there's nothing which can come in competition with Chriſt, but is infinitely below him. All the combined excellencies of creatures, put into the balance with Chriſt, bear not ſo much proportion as doth a <hi>feather</hi> to a <hi>mountain.</hi> To forſake <hi>Chriſt</hi> for the <hi>world,</hi> or a luſt, is to leave a <hi>treaſnre</hi> for a <hi>trifle;</hi> a mountain of gold, for an heap of dung; the pure laſting <hi>fountain,</hi> for the muddie <hi>broken ciſtern;</hi> Eternity for a moment; reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for a ſhadow; all things for nothing.

               <p>AT This <hi>verſe</hi> the Apoſtle begins the <hi>ſecond Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> whereby he proves it the duty of theſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians <hi>Earneſtly to contend for the Faith once delivered to the Saints,</hi> and now oppoſed by the ſeducers of thoſe times. The Argument is taken from the <hi>certainty</hi> of the deſtruction of thoſe Seducers: the Apoſtle by the zealous proſecution thereof, declaring, that theſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians muſt avoid their <hi>Doctrines,</hi> if they would not be involved in their <hi>downfall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle, in the managing of this Argument, doth theſe three things;
<list>
                     <item>1. He gives us ſeverall Examples of Gods <hi>ſevere wrath</hi> upon others in <hi>former</hi> times, for ſundry heinous ſins, to the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Verſe.</item>
                     <item>2. He declares that theſe Seducers lived in the <hi>ſame ſins</hi> which God had formerly puniſh'd <hi>in others;</hi> to the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe.</item>
                     <item>3. He concludes, that they <hi>practiſing the ſame impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> ſhall <hi>partake of the ſame plagues</hi> with thoſe who were before them, to the 17<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>For the firſt of theſe, the Apoſtle propounds <hi>three Examples</hi> of Gods moſt ſevere diſpleaſure againſt the ſinners of <hi>former times:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="376" facs="tcp:166520:196"/>
The firſt is of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who were <hi>deſtroyed in the wilderneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond of the wicked <hi>Angels, who are reſerved in everlaſting chains under darkneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third of the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> who <hi>ſuffer the vengeance of everlasting fire.</hi> The Apoſtle with admirable wiſdom making choice of <hi>theſe</hi> Examples, to prevent the plea which might be made for theſe Seducers, in regard of their <hi>priviledg,</hi> as viſible profeſſors, of their eminency for <hi>place,</hi> and of their reputation for <hi>ſanctity:</hi> For though they had <hi>Church-priviledges,</hi> yet ſo had the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites;</hi> though they were eminent for <hi>place</hi> and <hi>ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> yet ſo were the <hi>Angels;</hi> and though they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to be accounted in the higheſt form of religion and ſanctitie, yet were they as <hi>filthy</hi> and <hi>guilty</hi> as <hi>Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> a people as famous for <hi>Gods judgments,</hi> as they were infamous for their <hi>own impurities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe Examples, that of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who were <hi>destroyed in the wilderneſſe,</hi> &amp;c. is ſet down here in this <hi>fifth</hi> verſe; wherein are two parts:

                  <p n="1">1. In reſpect of the <hi>Apoſtle:</hi> It was his duty, not only <hi>once to deliver,</hi> but <hi>again to recall</hi> Truths to their minds, formerly delivered.

                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>beſt</hi> are <hi>imperfect in their knowledg.</hi> The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of thoſe things which we do know, is but the leaſt part of what we do not know. The plaineſt and beſt known Truths are not ſo well known, but they may be better known. The moſt experienced Chriſtian may ſay of <hi>every</hi> Truth, as a man uſeth to ſay to his <hi>new</hi> Friends, <hi>I would be glad of your better acquaintance. Our knowledg is but in part,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.9</note> even in reſpect of the <hi>plaineſt</hi> Truths. We cannot name any Number ſo high and great, but a man may reckon one ſtill beyond it and there may be alway an addition to our <hi>knowledg:</hi> A Chriſtian ſhould grow in his <hi>head,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 2.2. &amp; 1.9, 10. <hi>Fateor me Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſmi diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulum.</hi>
                     </note> as well as in his <hi>heart;</hi> in his <hi>light,</hi> as well as in his <hi>heat.</hi> 'Twas an humble ſpeech of <hi>Luther, I acknowledg my ſelf a Scholer even in the Catechiſm.</hi> Every point of Divinity hath a vaſt Circumference; every <hi>command is exceeding broad;</hi> and what one article of Faith, or precept of the Law is there of which a man may ſay, There is nothing contained in it, which I fully know not? Chriſtians ſhould often be remembred of the plaineſt truths, that they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of them the better.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>memories</hi> of the beſt Chriſtians <hi>ſtand in need of frequent remembrances:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 2.1.</note> They are frail to retain the things of God naturally. The moſt precious truths laid up in our <hi>memories,</hi> are Jewels put into a <hi>crazy</hi> Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net. Memorie is like a ſieve, that holds the bran, lets the flowre go; remembers what is to be forgotten, and forgets what is to be remembred: and like a ſieve that is full in the water, but empty being taken out: the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:166520:197"/>is full perhaps, while men are hearing, but empty ſo ſoon as their hearing is ended. If we would have our garment hold its colour, it muſt be double dyed; ſo, that a truth may take a deep impreſſion, it muſt be preſſed again and again. And this naturall unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the memory is furthered by the tentations of Satan, who labours to ſteal away the <hi>moſt uſefull</hi> truths: like a theef, who robs a houſe of the beſt houſholdſtuff. In times of tentation to ſin, how hard is it to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the truths that ſhould defend us! How far from <hi>Peters</hi> memory was the ſpeech of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Luk. 22.61.</note> till the <hi>crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the cock</hi> remembred him? <hi>Ye have forgotten</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>the exhortation,</hi> Heb. 12.5. In every ſin there is ſome kind of <hi>forgetfulneſſe.</hi> When paſſion is violent, and tentation ſtrong, the uſe of <hi>memorie</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſuſpended. <hi>Thou haſt greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and haſt forgotten mee, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Ezek. 22.12. And in all true obedience there is <hi>remembrance;</hi> Iſa. 64.5. <hi>working righteouſneſſe,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring God</hi> are put together.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>beſt</hi> Chriſtians are <hi>ſubject to abate and decay in ſpiritual fervency of affection to the beſt things.</hi> Now <hi>frequent</hi> remembrances do not only <hi>recall</hi> truths to the mind, but quicken the heart to affect them.

The freeſt Chriſtian ſometime wanteth the ſpur: Our very <hi>ſanctified</hi> affections are like heated water, which of it ſelf grows cold; but neither retains nor increaſeth its heats, unleſſe the fire be put under, and blown up.

                  <p>It may be demanded, Why the Apoſtle ſaith that the Chriſtians <hi>once knew this</hi> following example of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> of which hee puts them in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle mentions this <hi>knowledg</hi> of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that he may gain their good will and favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reſpect to the truth of which he was now ſpeaking, and that his arguing from theſe examples might the more eaſily find entertainment with them: For by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they <hi>knew this,</hi> 1. He labours to win them to a <hi>love of himſelf</hi> by commending them, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that good to <hi>be,</hi> which he <hi>ſaw in them.</hi> He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends them for their <hi>knowledg</hi> and expertneſſe in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and declares that he ſpake not to rude &amp; ignorant, but to expert Chriſtians. 2. He gains the reputation of <hi>certainty</hi> to the truths of which he was ſpeaking, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing for this to their own knowledg, which was ſo clear herein,
<note place="margin">Concerning the word <hi>once,</hi> I have ſpoken largely before, <hi>pag.</hi> 231, 232.</note> that he amplifieth it, by ſaying, that they knew it <hi>once,</hi> that is, certainly, unchangeably, and <hi>once for all,</hi> never to revoke and alter this knowledg: and both theſe inſinuations uſeth <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.15. <hi>I ſpeak as to wiſe men, judg ye what I ſay:</hi> And to <hi>Agrippa,</hi> for the gaining his favour to that cauſe which he there defended, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.3. <hi>I think my ſelfe happy, that I ſhall anſwer for my ſelfe before thee, &amp;c. becauſe I know thee to be expert in all cuſtomes, and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions which are among the Jews.</hi> And ver. 26. <hi>The king knoweth of theſe things, before whom I ſpeak freely.</hi> 3.

<note place="margin">Exod. 36 4. Pſal. 106.20.</note> was, becauſe
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:166520:204"/>they had often ſeen the Egyptians, under that kinde of image to worſhip either their greatly adored <hi>Apis,</hi> who had formerly been their King and benefactor, and whom now they eſteemed their tutelary god; or elſe (as other learned men think) the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> which by its inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation did make the land of <hi>Egypt</hi> fruitfull. And very probable it is, that God intended this bitter oppreſſion of the Iſraelites by the Egyptians, partly as a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for joyning with them in their <hi>idolatry</hi> formerly; partly as a remedy, to prevent in the Iſraelites that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity and friendſhip with the Egyptians for time to come, whereby they might eaſily fall again in love with their <hi>ſuperſtitions.</hi> For if after all the indignities and cruelties which the Iſraelites ſuffered in Egypt, they were deſirous again (as they were) to return thither;

They had lately defiled the <hi>rivers</hi> with the <hi>blood</hi> of infants; See now their rivers red with blood, and they themſelves are afterward <hi>over-whelmed in the red ſea.</hi> He who had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſatisfie his own curioſity by the feats of Magicians than labour for humility under ſtroakes, not more, ſmart than miraculous, is at once both deluded and hardened.

They who are not taught,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:166520:206"/>juſtly ſtumble by the people of God. To conclude this, How juſt was it, that he who with his people hoped that the Iſraelites were ſo <hi>intangled</hi> and <hi>ſhut up in the wilderneſſe</hi> and the <hi>ſea,</hi> as they ſhould not be able to make eſcape; that he and his (I ſay) ſhould by this bait be drawn ſo far to purſue the Iſraelites, as neither to be able to go backward or forward.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. This deſtruction of the Iſraelites <hi>afterward,</hi> was a miſcarriage after <hi>vaſt coſt and expences</hi> laid out <hi>upon</hi> them. How <hi>angry</hi> is that <hi>father</hi> with his Son, who caſts him off after all his care and coſts of education! How <hi>hatefull</hi> is that houſe to the owner, which he pulls down after vaſt and immeaſurable expences about its ſtructure and furniture! How much anger did God expreſſe in the deſtruction of the Temple, when after all the coſt which <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> laid out upon it, the Babylonians burn it to aſhes, and carry away all the gold and ſumptuous monuments thereof! Was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver God at ſuch charges with any nation as he was at with Iſrael? <hi>For their ſake</hi> he turns Egypt up ſide down, he <hi>rebuked</hi> kings, he ſcattered and deſtroyed armies; the wild water waites upon them in a ſtanding poſture; the <hi>Pillar of a cloud</hi> and <hi>fire</hi> conducts them; the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens pour them down miraculous ſhours of <hi>Angels food;</hi> the rock ſplits it ſelf into cups, and gives them drink; their garments continue freſh, and grow not old; and which is infinitely beyond all this, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes his Covenant with them, and gives them a law from heaven, ſpeakes out of the fire, and ſends them an epiſtle to inſtruct them, written with his own hand; and after all this coſt and care, how great muſt Iſraels deſtruction be!</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Yet further, this deſtruction of the Iſraelites, <hi>afterward,</hi> was a ſad <hi>diſappointment of higheſt expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> Iſrael was now caſt away, as it were, in the <hi>haven.</hi> They who not long ſince were ſinging and dancing, at the ſpectacle of floting <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his followers; they who had paſt thorow the furnace and the ſea, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped both their oppreſſours and purſuers; they who had ſafely marched through an hot <hi>howling wilderneſſe,</hi>

                  <p n="5">5 The originall or beginning of the ſin of theſe Angels, was the <hi>defectibility</hi> and <hi>mutability</hi> of their own will; whereby, though for the preſent, they willed that which was good, and might have willed to have perſevered therein; yet being mutable, they might alſo will evill, and ſo fall from God. Every creature as its made of nothing, may again, unleſſe ſuſtained by God, return to nothing; and in that reſpect it was that the intellectuall creature might make a defection from him who created it, and deviate from the rule of divine righteouſneſſe: for (as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Auguſtine</hi> obſerves) the <hi>being</hi> of nature comes from hence, that its made by <hi>God:</hi> the <hi>defection</hi> of nature from hence, that its made of <hi>nothing.</hi> If there be any creatures therefore, which cannot ſin, they have not this from the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of nature, but from the gift of the grace of God: And <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſeems to argue rightly, that <hi>according to the condition of nature, none is exempted from a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſinning, but only God:</hi> in regard that ſin being the declining of an act from the rectitude of the rule, <hi>it is onely impoſſible for that act not to decline from recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, the rule of which, is the very power and will of the
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:166520:246"/>agent; for</hi> (as he well illuſtrates it) <hi>if the hand of the artificer, were the very rule of cutting a piece of timber, the artificer could not but cut the wood evenly and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but if the rectitude of the cutting, be by another, an externall rule, the cutting may either be right, or not right. The divine will is onely the rule of his act, as not being ordained to any higher end: but the will of every creature hath in its act no rectitude, but as it is regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the will of God, which is its ultimate end.</hi> And hence it is, that notwithſtanding the nature of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall creature was good, yet evill is ſaid to ariſe and proceed from it; and that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſo frequently, and others after him, aſſert, that evill hath its originall and beginning from that which was good: For though evill doth not proceed from good, (ſaith Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi>) as that good was made <hi>by God,</hi> yet it did proceed from good,

                  <p>A fourth (to adde no more) and the moſt probable opinion, is, of thoſe who hold that the firſt ſin of theſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels was <hi>pride.</hi> And this is the opinion moſt received and commonly embraced by the Fathers: and after them received generally by the Schoolmen and others. <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſeems ſtrongly to prove, that it <hi>could</hi> be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſin but pride. A ſpirituall nature (and ſuch is the angelicall) can only (ſaith he) affect ſome ſpiritual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as being that which is only agreeable to it; now there can be no ſin in affecting ſpirituall objects, which in themſelves are good, unleſs it be becauſe in affecting of them, the rule of the ſuperiour is therein not obeyed; and this is the ſin of <hi>pride.</hi> For the proper object of pride (ſaith <hi>Cajetan</hi>) is ſomething exceeding that meaſure prefixed and limited by God. Now in regard ſpirituall things cannot be exceſſive, nor can we have too much of them in reſpect of themſelves, becauſe the more of them the better; it followes, that then they come to be ſinfully deſired, when they begin to exceed, and to become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commenſurate to the divine rule and diſpenſation: the affecting them in which inordinate meaſure, namely, beyond the limits preſcribed by God, was the ſin of <hi>pride</hi> in the <hi>angels.</hi> That this pride then, or an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting (as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> calls it) of ſome ſpirituall highneſs, beyond the bounds of Gods will, was the <hi>firſt ſin,</hi> ſeems very probable by reaſon; but more then probable by that of <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6. where the Apoſtle gives this
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:166520:248"/>reaſon, why a Biſhop muſt be <hi>no novice,

                  <p>But more <hi>particularly,</hi> if it be enquired, <hi>wherein</hi> this pride of the angels did conſiſt, and what that highneſſe was, which they did affect beyond their meaſure; I think, the anſwer hereunto can be but conjecturall and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
                  <p>Some conceive that it was revealed to the Angels, ſoon after their creation, that the <hi>humane nature</hi> ſhould in time be hypoſtatically united to the <hi>divine,</hi> that the Son of God, in humane nature, ſhould be the <hi>head</hi> of men, yea of angels; that hereby mans nature was to be exalted <hi>above</hi> the very angels,
<note place="margin">Heb. 1.6.</note> and that they were commanded to <hi>worſhip and ſubmit to him.</hi> Hereupon (ſay ſome) they deſired that the dignity of this union with the <hi>divine</hi> might be affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to their own <hi>angelical</hi> nature. But (ſay others) they refuſed to conſent and ſubmit to Gods pleaſure in the former diſcovery;

                  <p>Others conjecture (for indeed none in this point can do much more) that the angels deſired to be equal with God, and that they aſpired to the divinity it ſelf.

And as the holy are confirmed in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo the fallen angels are hardned in the love of that which formerly they made choice of. This is intended by Chriſt, in thoſe words, <hi>John</hi> 8.44. <hi>There is no truth in him,</hi> they cannot ſo much as will to do well, but they do immovably cleave to wickedneſſe. Theſe trees, as they <hi>have faln, ſo they lie.</hi> Angels went ſo far, that they never turn; they fell ſo low, they never ariſe. This is proved from their eternall miſery, which the Scripture mentions in this <hi>verſe,</hi> and elſe where frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; this everlaſtingneſſe of their puniſhment, including the perpetuity of their ſinning; and ſuch an eternall forſaking of them by God, that they ſhall never have <hi>righteouſneſſe repaired</hi> in them again. The ſchool-men are too curious, in inquiring into the ground of this total &amp; final fal of the angels into ſin. <hi>Aquinas,</hi> and his followers hold, that their obſtinacy proceeds from the very nature of the <hi>wils</hi> of angels, according to which (ſay they) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are ſo inflexible and immovable, that they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>hate</hi> that which once they have <hi>choſen,</hi> nor <hi>chuſe</hi> that which once they have <hi>hated;</hi> but, as I conceive, <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia</hi> overthrowes this opinion, by arguing, that if the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability of the good angels from good to evill, be not from <hi>nature,</hi> but from <hi>grace</hi> only, who yet did with ful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation chuſe that which was good; then the immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the evil angels from evil to good comes not from
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:166520:250"/>
                     <hi>nature,</hi> but from the juſt and <hi>totall deprivation</hi> of grace. Others of them aſſert, That God preſerves in the wils of the divels an <hi>hatred</hi> of himſelfe, and that this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation is an act of <hi>punitive</hi> juſtice, and that God cauſeth that wicked habit in the wils of the divels, whereby they are neceſſarily inclined to ſin; and this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious opinion is aſſerted by <hi>Occham, Biel,</hi> and <hi>Aureolus;</hi> which I note by the way, as wiſhing that while the <hi>Papiſts</hi> behold a <hi>ſuppoſed mote</hi> in the eye of holy <hi>Calvin,</hi> they would obſerve thoſe <hi>reall beams</hi> which are in the eyes of their own moſt famous Schoolmen, as to this point of making God the Authour of ſin. But thoſe who ſpeak more modeſtly and piouſly, then either of the former, give this reaſon of the obſtinacy of the fallen angels: namely, the totall and perfect privation of all holineſſe: which is conſiderable, 1.

How great then ſhall this judgement day be! for how great at that day ſhall every ſin appear to be! Sin can never bee ſeen to be what it is, or in its due dimenſions, but by the light of the fire of Gods wrath. In the dim and falſe light of this world, it's nothing, it's nothing, a trick of youth, a toy, a trifle; but at the appearing of the light of divine diſquiſition, when conſcience ſhall be <hi>ſearch'd with candles,</hi> and all paint, pretexts, and other refuges ſwept away, the leaſt ſin will appear infinite.

The ſentence whereby a man for a while is reprieved, recovers a little loſſe, or hath ſmall damages given, is little regarded, and ſoon forgotten; but that whereby a man hath his life, and with that, his eſtate and liberty, and all that is dear and deſirable granted unto him; this his ſentence and judgment (I ſay) is great, and makes the day wherein it paſſeth deſervedly to bee

Egypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> abounding with waters and plenty, are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, not onely unto thoſe who are without the Church, but who are enemies of the Church. In theſe countries God made his people ſlaves and captives (and truly it's ſafeſt for <hi>Iſrael</hi> to meet with moſt woe in places of moſt wealth.)

                  <p>Breifly (now) though ſutably to this branch of Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſhall add to the diſcovery of the ſorts of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a touch of the peculiar odiouſneſſe of this ſin (to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the conſideration of the wrath of God againſt it, till we come to the next part.) 1. It's a <hi>cloſe</hi> and cleaving ſin, much cheriſh'd by corrupt nature. It bears (as a Reverend Divine notes) the name of it's mother, which is called in generall <hi>luſt,</hi> or <hi>concupiſcence;</hi> it hath the name of it is kind, and therefore it is <hi>luſt,</hi> eminently; it
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:166520:290"/>lies near the heart, and ſleeps in the boſome. 2. It's an <hi>Infatuating</hi> ſin, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.11. taking away the heart; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>David</hi> was led with a ſtupor of ſpirit for a whole year together, after his uncleanneſſe. How did this ſin beſot <hi>Samſon?</hi> It blunts the edge not of <hi>grace</hi> only, but even of <hi>reaſon</hi> alſo; even <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelfe could not keep his wiſdome and women at once. 3. Its an <hi>Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> ſin to others; It loves not to go to hell without company: An Adulterer cannot ſay (as ſome other ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners may) that he is his own <hi>greateſt</hi> enemy. How many doth it (beſides thoſe whom it kils in ſoul) wound in body, name, at one ſhoot! and for this wound there can be no ſalve of reſtitution or recompence. 4. Its an <hi>attended</hi> ſin; not only inducing others to ſin, but it brings on other ſins with it; it's like the needle which draws the thread after it; idolatry, perjuries, murders, riot, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding even of neareſt relations. The Apoſtle joyns <hi>fornication</hi> and <hi>wickedneſſe,</hi>

It's a <hi>Sacrilegious</hi> ſin: It takes away from God that which is his own; he made our bodies,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 139.15.</note> and <hi>curioufly wrought them like a piece of tapeſtry,</hi> and he will not have them to be ſpotted.

                  <p n="1">1. Our <hi>naturall forwardneſſe</hi> to ſin in like manner.

<note place="margin">Act. 19.28. 1 Sam. 2.22.25.

The <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beonites</hi> were as refractory to the meſſage of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as they were addicted to filthineſſe: The <hi>Sodomites</hi> were at the ſame time both ſet upon their uncleaneſſe, and enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt <hi>Lots counſel.</hi> The <hi>Anabaptiſts of Munſter</hi> were grown to that heighth of uncleanneſſe, that they openly taught, men might marry as many wives as they pleaſed, and <hi>John of Leyden</hi> their King (upon a preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded revelation from Heaven) preſently marryed three; and they who were moſt bold in this kind, and took moſt wives, were accounted the beſt men, and moſt
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:166520:327"/>commendable. But the fruit of this Doctrine, was their teaching that before the day of Judgement, Chriſt had a worldly Kingdome, and in that the Saints only had Dominion, that this Kingdom was that of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> newly begun, wherein Magiſtracy was to be rooted out; and although Chriſt and his Apoſtles had no civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet that they had committed the ſame with the power of the ſword to thoſe who after them ſhould teach in the Church. Nor is it poſſible, but that <hi>luſt</hi> ſhould vehemently oppoſe reſtraint, conſidering its propenſions and motions are naturall, and therefore ſtrong, as alſo furthered by all the helps which a powerfull and impure ſpirit can invent and apply. Falſe then is the pretence of <hi>Libertines,</hi> who would be thought only ro oppoſe the irregularities of Magiſtracy or Miniſtry, when as it is clear that their luſts are moſt offended at the being of their ordinations, and the conſciencious diſcharge of them. And much ſhould this comfort thoſe who are thus conſciencious, in the midſt of all the rage and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach with which they are followed for their faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. It is a ſign they have diſquieted mens luſts, and (as <hi>Luther</hi> once ſaid) that <hi>when Satan roars, they have given him a full blow.</hi> Nor yet ſhould the unquietneſſe and troubles of the world, be laid at the door of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint</hi> and <hi>Dominion.</hi> If religious oppoſition, drawes out mens rage, it doth it by labouring to keep it in, or rather to take it away; <hi>From mens luſts are warres,</hi> in that they will not ſtoop to God, who will not lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide his dominion to gratifie licenciouſneſſe. In a word, We may hence gather the inſufficiency of humane laws, nay any externall means to change the heart from a love of ſin: they may poſſibly reſtrein and curb, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently they irritate and enrage ſinners, its only the power of grace at once to take away the diſobedience of the life, and the deſpiſing of the heart. To conclude, We may hence learn the direct way to avoid the ſin of theſe Seducers; oppoſe luſts, theſe put people upon op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:166520:328"/>of Magiſtracy; Such are, 1. <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> when men deſire to ſet the Nations on fire, that they may ſteal away the goods, and to have States wrackt that the goods may be caſt upon their coſts. 2. <hi>Diſcontentedneſſe</hi> with our condition. The trees in <hi>Jothams</hi> Parable pleaſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their own ſtation, of privacy and uſefulneſſe; and ſhe was a wiſe woman who contented her ſelfe with her abode <hi>among her own people.</hi> 3. <hi>Ambition,</hi> and affectation of ſuperiority; its better to be fit to rule, then to rule and not to be fit. He is only worthy of honour, of whom honour it ſelf is unworthy, and to whom it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſues for acceptance. <hi>Abſolom</hi> aſpired to be high in his life, and he was in his death as high as the boughs of the tree, a fit reward for his ambitious climbing. 4. <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy at the height of others,</hi> whereby men look into the failings of Magiſtrates to blemiſh them, and will not ſee the gifts and graces of their Superiors, but only with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining; grieving not becauſe things go ill, but becauſe they go no worſe; A curſed temper! 5. <hi>Selfe concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſſe,</hi> whereby (with <hi>Abſolom</hi>) men think themſelves fitter to ſit at the ſtern, then any placed there already. 6. <hi>Implacableneſſe,</hi> whereby private injuries are retain'd with a watching of all occaſions of revenge, though to the involving of multitudes in the co-partnerſhip of their own ſedition and deſtruction. In a word, So long as we love luſt, we cannot conſcienciouſly obey Magiſerates; and yet ſo long as we have luft, we cannot be without Magiſtrates; The Lord fit us for that condition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we ſhall not be troubled with the former, nor ſtand in need of the later.</p>
